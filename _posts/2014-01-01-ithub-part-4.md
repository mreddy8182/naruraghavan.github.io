Continuing from where we left off in [**Part 3**]({{ site.url }}/ithub-part-3), lets start exploring the application integration aspects of itHUB a little more in this post.

### E.   External Service Provider’s Products and Services Integration
This section will discuss the integration of Walmart’s products and services to itHUB using the Walmart Data Feed API [10].  

#### 1)  Data Integration
To get a list of items by category, we have to register with the Walmart Open API and acquire an apiKey. Once the apiKey is acquired, there are several methods available to retrieve items as follows:

1. **Lookup API** - Get Items - /v1/items/id
2. **Taxonomy API** - Get Taxonomy - /v1/taxonomy
3. **Search API** - Get Search - /v1/search

##### a) Data Semantics
Walmart’s product data semantics is shown below:

{% highlight xml %}
<items>
    <item>
        <itemId></itemId>
        <parentItemId></parentItemId>
        <name></name>
        <salePrice></salePrice>
        <upc></upc>
        <categoryPath></categoryPath>
        <shortDescription></shortDescription>
        <longDescription></longDescription>
        <thumbnailImage></thumbnailImage>
        <productTrackingUrl></productTrackingUrl>
        <standardShipRate></standardShipRate>
        <marketplace></marketplace>
        <modelNumber></modelNumber>
        <productUrl></productUrl>
        <customerRating></customerRating>
        <numReviews></numReviews>
        <customerRatingImage></customerRatingImage>
        <categoryNode></categoryNode>
        <bundle></bundle>
        <availableOnline></availableOnline>
    </item>
</items>
{% endhighlight %}

##### b) Data Format
Data Feed API can either return data in the XML or JSON format. An example product is shown in the JSON format below:

{% highlight json %}
{"items": [
    {
        "itemId": 24699992,
        "parentItemId": 24699992,

#### 2)  Process Integration

##### a) Interface Process
The requestor of the data feed will make a call as follows:

![Walmart Interface Process]({{ site.url }}/images/walmart-interface-process.png)
{: .pull-right}

Request Management component needs a translator service to enable the processing of product data to and from Walmart API services. 

##### b) Workflow
One of the attributes, productUrl, shown in the JSON code block, represents the deep linked URL that directly links to the product page of the item on walmart.com, and uniquely identifies the affiliate (itHUB in this case) sending this request via a linkshare tracking id |LSNID| [11]. In this case, the ordering process with the external service provider can be as simple as a link-out to the deep linked web page on the Walmart.com website.

#### 3)  Application Integration
To seamlessly integrate with the request management component as described in the previous section, the products and services data from the external service providers such as Walmart and Staples have to be translated to and from the itHUB product and service vocabulary. One of the methods of implementation design is shown below:

![itHUB Application Integration with External Service Providers]({{ site.url }}/images/ithub-application-integration-with-external-service-providers.png)
{: .pull-right}

##### a) Walmart Product Mapper
The responsibility of the Product Mapper is to extract all the necessary attributes from the “item” response XML/JSON string and create an itHUB-compatible external product item that can be represented using a common web interface. By the same token, for item inquiry or item order details, the mapper will convert the “Request” to Walmart API specific item specification.

##### b) itHUB Walmart Gateway 
The responsibility of the Walmart Gateway is to receive and submit the product data from and to the Walmart Open API. 

### F.   User Management
As discussed in the previous section, to create a singular view about the customer, itHUB user management component might have to assemble the information from a wide variety of data sources – user directory, ERP systems such as SAP, employee management software systems such as PeopleSoft to name a few. The following entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows a simplistic implementation of some of the attributes needed to properly service customers:

![User Management]({{ site.url }}/images/user-management.jpg)
{: .pull-right}

To pull customer-related information from multiple data sources, the following design could be implemented.

![E-R Diagram for User Management Integration]({{ site.url }}/images/user-management-integration.png)
{: .pull-right}

#### 1)  Repository
The responsibility of the repository is to encapsulate storage, retrieval, and search behavior and to emulate a collection of objects (Evans, 2003).  

##### a) ERP Repository
This is a specialized implementation of the Repository to deal with ERP systems and can be further specialized to deal with a specific ERP system – e.g. SAP Repository.

##### b) User Repository
This is a specialized implementation of the Repository to extract user details of customers from a user store such as an Active Directory. This can also be further specialized to deal with specific user stores.

#### 2)  User Service
The responsibility of the User Service is to retrieve and assemble user details, billing details etc. from a wide variety of repositories described above.

I'll contiunue my discussion in the next post.
