  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Continuing from where we left off in <a href="http://localhost:4000/ithub-part-2"><strong>Part 2</strong></a>, lets start exploring the software architecture of itHUB a little more in this post.</p>

<h3 id="c---technology-web-20-and-beyond">C.   Technology: Web 2.0 and Beyond</h3>
<p class="pull-right">The use of Web 2.0 and beyond [9] is a must for the itHUB platform. The following diagram illustrates the architectural layers and partitions of itHUB platform software components:
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/layers-and-Partitions-of-itHUB.png" alt="Layers and Partitions of itHUB" /></p>

<h4 id="internal-products-and-services">1)  Internal Products and Services</h4>
<p>These products and services are the core competencies of the IT departments. These products and services could range from homegrown applications to hardware and software bundles that the IT departments have direct control over. </p>

<h4 id="ithub-data-store">2)  itHUB Data Store</h4>
<p>This is a dedicated data store to itHUB platform for the purposes of storing and retrieving its constructs such as “requests”.</p>

<h4 id="external-products-and-services">3)  External Products and Services</h4>
<p>These are from the external service providers such as Walmart, Staples and PC Connection – a select set of products and services that conform to the standards and compliance needs of the IT organization.
The products and services from the external service providers will be accessed using their application interfaces (API) and added to the internal products and services to create the consolidated portfolio of products and services.</p>

<h4 id="request-management">4)  Request Management</h4>
<p>Request Management is the crux of the itHUB platform as shown in Figure 7. Requests are managed in two steps as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Configure/Provide Request Types – Either the service providers or the service administrator carries out this step. This is the first step in making a set of requests available to the IT customers to choose from and ultimately requested for. These are configurations or specifications of the requests and not the requests themselves. For example, to process a desktop request, the IT department might need a set of data points such as “Is this a new or replacement desktop?” or “How much RAM is required?” etc. Without these values, processing of the desktop request may not be possible. 
Plus, the list of approvers is specified for each of the request type. For example, for a desktop request, there may be a need for approvals from the department manager and the general manager (or some suitable roles).</li>
</ol>

<p class="pull-right"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/request-management.png" alt="Request Management" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Create/Track Requests – After choosing one of the request types, for example, the desktop request, the customer goes on to fill out the necessary data points and submits the request. Once the request is submitted, it is routed for approvals based on the specification of the request type. As described in the previous section, a desktop request will be routed to the department manager and the general manager of the customer who submitted the request. After submitting the request, the customer could check on the status of the request including the approvals.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="approval-workflow">5)  Approval Workflow</h4>
<p>As shown in the above picture, the approval workflow enables the management team to ensure that the requested products or services are really a need for the requestor’s job role. One of the primary steps of this component is described below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Approve/Reject Requests – In this step, requests are either approved or rejected by the approvers. Email/SMS channels will be utilized to send and receive approval notices.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="user-management">6)  User Management</h4>
<p>This is where the customer data is managed. As described in the previous sections, customer data includes location information such as address, building, and floor details, billing information in terms of cost center, project number or internal order number etc., and the department information including manager details. </p>

<h4 id="user-management-store">7)  User Management Store</h4>
<p>The data points about the customer needed to process requests successfully might spread across multiple data stores and ERP systems. There may be a need to assemble the customer data from a wide variety of data sources such as PeopleSoft, Asset management database, LDAP directories to create a unified view of the customer.</p>

<h4 id="erp">8)  ERP</h4>
<p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) might house the relevant billing information for itHUB to associate with customers and their requests. As described in the previous section, the billable information could include cost center, project number or internal order number for cross charging purposes.</p>

<h4 id="web-layer">9)  Web Layer</h4>
<p>The web layer would include components such as wiki/blog creation framework, web application frameworks such as J2EE-based Spring framework for web site navigation development, data persistence, web service development, and for messaging. </p>

<h3 id="d---ithub--the-system-boundary">D.   itHUB – The System Boundary</h3>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the system boundary and the dependencies of itHUB with external systems both managed by the IT department and external service providers.</p>

<p class="pull-right"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/ithub-system-boundary.png" alt="itHUB System Boundary" /></p>

<p>As shown in the diagram, the user infrastructure could be a combination of systems such as PeopleSoft, corporate LDAP directory etc. The billing information such as cost center details could be housed in ERP systems such as SAP. Therefore, the user management component has to deal with assembling a unified view of the customer. The request management component has to deal with receiving and processing the external service provider’s product data. 
The following section will go over the data semantics and formats for enabling the integration of customer data with internal to IT, but external to itHUB and exchanging products and services from external suppliers.</p>

<p>I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Continuing from where we left off in <a href="http://localhost:4000/ithub-part-1"><strong>Part 1</strong></a>, lets start exploring the interactive model and the need for itHUB a little more in this post.</p>

<h2 id="iii--interactive-model">III.  INTERACTIVE MODEL</h2>
<p>In the interactive model, the IT departments provide an e-business platform with a unified web interface to search, submit, track IT requests for their customers. The platform will also provide facilities for service providers to deliver on the requests in terms of ordering items and updating the details of the requests across multiple systems. In addition to the above requirements, the platform should also provide ways in which an IT customer can pose questions and get answers either from the other IT customers or from an IT service provider. The remainder of the article will refer to such an e-business platform as itHUB. </p>

<h3 id="a---ithub--the-platform">A.   itHUB – The Platform</h3>
<p class="pull-right">A two-sided platform [3] is a good starting point for itHUB. There are consumers that will request for services, check for statuses, post questions and/or answers, write blog articles, and rate the quality of services offered. There are service providers – IT departments – that fulfill requests. There are approvers – typically, managers of requestors – to approve requests made by their department users, so that the service providers can fulfill them.<br />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/two-sided-ithub-platform.png" alt="2-sided itHUB Platform" /></p>

<p>In addition to IT departments, service providers can also be external vendors such as Walmart, Staples etc. Both platform provider and the sponsor could be the IT organization in question. </p>

<h4 id="platform-sponsor-vs-platform-provider">1)  Platform Sponsor vs. Platform Provider</h4>
<p>If the itHUB platform is built with enough abstraction, there is a possibility for IT organizations to repurpose itHUB so that it could be used as a service delivery platform for other departments. For example, a car manufacturer’s employee sales department could make use of the itHUB platform to fulfill car requests. In this particular case, the IT department will become the platform sponsor and the employee sales department will become the platform provider. The following section describes the network effects in itHUB.</p>

<h4 id="the-network-effects">2)  The Network Effects</h4>
<p>Network effect is the effect that one customer of the IT products or services has on the value of those products or services to other consumers [4].  The itHUB platform will benefit from having such network effects as shown in the next picture. </p>

<h5 id="a-same-side-network-effect">a) Same-side Network Effect</h5>
<p><em>Customer-to-Customer Network effect</em> is positive since more customers make IT products and services better. This is possible because of the interactions among the customers through social questions and answers and wikis/blogs. The more customers pose questions/answers and write blog articles about the IT products and services for clarification and usage scenarios. </p>

<p class="pull-right"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/network-effect.png" alt="The Network Effect" /></p>

<p><em>Service Provider-to-Service Provider Network</em> Effect is negative as increased competition makes itHUB less attractive to external service providers such as Walmart, Staples, and PC Connection etc. The same-side network effect among internal IT service providers is positive as the internal IT departments work with each other to deliver on the IT requests.</p>

<h5 id="b-cross-side-network-effect">b) Cross-side Network Effect</h5>
<p><em>Customer-to-Service Provider Network Effect</em> is positive as more customers attract more external service providers. 
<em>Service Provider-to-Customer Network Effect</em> is positive as more service providers attract more customers as the perceived speed of delivery of IT products and services by the customers.</p>

<h5 id="c-ideas-for-creating-and-sustaining-the-network-effect">c) Ideas for creating and sustaining the Network Effect</h5>
<p>IT service management is often considered a one-time deal where customers are thought to come to IT for services and go away until another need arises. Though this is true, there is an opportunity for IT departments to create a loyal customer base where not only the IT support team but also the application teams can hear about the voices of the customers in terms of application user interface design, development, and deployment. This feedback loop is valuable in terms of designing applications for the better in the future. 
By creating an integrated e-business platform where not only IT requests are easier to create, submit, and track, but also providing a way for the customers to receive a fast, accurate, and friendly answers [5]. In this case, it is not just the IT support team that is responsible, but the entire community of IT customers and the service providers bears the responsibility of helping each other. As long as the platform is easy to use, reaching the critical mass, unlike in a public social platform, should not be a problem for IT departments since IT customers are the employees of the organization where IT departments are a part.  </p>

<p>When it comes to external IT service providers such as Walmart, Staples, PC Connection etc., the platform has to ensure that the “winner-takes-all” scenario does not exist [6]. This can be easily mitigated with a procurement policy. </p>

<p>The next section discusses a couple of digital business models that the IT departments could adapt to further sustaining the network effect. </p>

<h3 id="b---the-digital-business-model">B.   The Digital Business Model</h3>
<p>IT could employ the Click-and-Mortar (C&amp;M) business model [7] where it maintains a web storefront in addition to its physical office space. IT must exercise the Infomediary model [7] to facilitate transactions between the consumers and the external service providers such as Walmart, Staples, PC Connection etc. To facilitate the social interactions among its customers and the service providers, IT could employ the Community model [7]. 
Each business model – C&amp;M, Infomediary, and Community – can be implemented in terms of content, customer experience, and the platform [8] and built into itHUB as follows:</p>

<p class="pull-right"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/components-of-the-digital-business-model.png" alt="The Components of the Digital Business Model" /></p>

<h4 id="content">1) Content</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Product/Service information.
    <ul>
      <li>IT related products and services information include description, images and videos, price, policies, and procedures for hardware, software, and applications offered by the IT department.</li>
      <li>External service provider catalog.
        <ul>
          <li>This requires an integration of itHUB with the external service provider’s e-catalog and order placement solutions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Questions and Answers
    <ul>
      <li>Questions and answers could also be posted by IT personnel in addition to being posted by the customers (user-generated)</li>
      <li>Questions and answers are related to the products and services offered by the IT department and the external service providers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>IT Product/Service related wikis and blog articles
    <ul>
      <li>HOW-TO articles describing the usage of a particular hardware, software, or applications with images and videos
        <ul>
          <li>For example, virus outbreaks and mitigation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="customer-experience">2)  Customer Experience</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Easy-to-use
    <ul>
      <li>To create and sustain the network effect as described in the previous section, itHUB has to employ good usability guidelines
        <ul>
          <li>For example, 1-click request submission when the customer profile is completely known</li>
          <li>If the customer is a new hire, allow ways in which multiple related items could be ordered in one request
            <ul>
              <li>This is an example of a composite request where several individual requests are added to one parent request</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shopping cart
    <ul>
      <li>itHUB must provide a way to instruct the customers regarding the number of items and the prices that they are about to request</li>
      <li>There should be a way to save a set of items for later submission</li>
      <li>There should be a way to save and send a set of items for a different customer to submit the order</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cost center / Project-based billing
    <ul>
      <li>itHUB must have access to the billing information of the customer to facilitate ordering price-based items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Messaging 
    <ul>
      <li>Email/SMS acknowledgement
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever a request is placed and until the request is completely satisfied, itHUB must notify the requestor regularly through emails or text messages</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Alerts 
        <ul>
          <li>Notify the requestor whenever approval/rejection workflow is carried out</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Customer generated Content
    <ul>
      <li>Ratings and reviews
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a way for customers to rate/review the products and services they received
            <ul>
              <li>This is an important feedback mechanism by which IT departments can and will learn about the products and services they are offering</li>
              <li>Sentiment Analysis can be carried out on the reviews to figure out the satisfaction levels of customers</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A)
            <ul>
              <li>Q&amp;A is a great way to create the network effect described in the previous section</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Detailed history of requests
    <ul>
      <li>This is a great way to promulgate the amount of work IT has done to its customers, business units, and the entire organization</li>
      <li>Keeping track of the detailed history of requests along with comments, ratings, reviews etc. will provide IT an opportunity to infer the seasonality, satisfaction levels of customers, improvement needs among others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tailored recommendations based on the customer profile or the business unit 
    <ul>
      <li>This feature is a differentiator in which the itHUB will be perceived as a platform that understands the needs of its customers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="platform">3)  Platform</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Internal components
    <ul>
      <li>Customer data
        <ul>
          <li>Address along with location, building, and floor</li>
          <li>Customer’s position or title and department
            <ul>
              <li>To facilitate the approval process, the customer’s title is important</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Customer Billing Information
        <ul>
          <li>Cost center, inter order number, project number are some of the attributes that are needed to be captured for the purposes of billing the customer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>External components
    <ul>
      <li>Shipment of physical products to remote locations using UPS, FedEx etc.
        <ul>
          <li>In a geographically separated organizations, IT must take shipment of items to respective business units into account</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Product and Services data from external service providers such as Walmart, Staples, and PC Connection
        <ul>
          <li>This is the crux of enabling B2B commerce with the external service providers</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
