  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Choices abound when it comes to developing websites and to managing them efficiently. This paper outlines a set of web technologies that can be used to build out both the client- and server-side components of J2EE-based websites. In addition to specifying the technologies to be used at various tiers, this paper also discusses best practices in structuring the work products for website deployment using continuous delivery concepts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i----application-architecture&quot;&gt;I.    APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will stick to the typical web application architecture as shown in the following diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/application-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section will outline the prescribed technologies for each one of the layers and partitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a--programming-language&quot;&gt;A.  Programming Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code elements to use Java 1.7+. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build scripts, unit, acceptance, and integration tests can be written using Groovy 2.3+ [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;b---presentation-layer-client&quot;&gt;B.   Presentation Layer (Client)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/presentation-layer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This layer is primarily concerned with user interfaces and ways in which they are presented to the end user. We shall use the following technologies for the above-mentioned packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-interfaces&quot;&gt;1)  User Interfaces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML5, CSS3, CSS Preprocessors such as Less [2], Bootstrap 3.0+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presentation-logic-client&quot;&gt;2)  Presentation Logic (Client)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember.js [3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c--presentation-layer-server&quot;&gt;C.  Presentation Layer (Server)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This layer is responsible for producing dynamic content from the layers below and for providing support for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presentation-logic-server&quot;&gt;1)  Presentation Logic (Server)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Framework, Spring MVC, Tiles 3, JSTL/Thymeleaf [4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML5-compliant email templates can be created with Thymeleaf templating engine [5].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Framework will provide support for dependency injection for controllers, components, resources, repositories, and services [6]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presentation-models&quot;&gt;2)  Presentation Models&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentation Models shall be POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) with a little bit of behavior in them to support both client- and server-side presentation logic elements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d--service-layer&quot;&gt;D.  Service Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/service-layer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This layer is responsible for providing support for structuring micro-services in terms of service interfaces and implementations, events that are used as data transfer objects between the presentation and the persistence or data tiers. This layer will also house the domain model converters, when needed, to convert domain models to the needs of the presentation tier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;service-interfaces&quot;&gt;1)  Service Interfaces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service Interfaces will be straightforward Java interfaces. Service implementations would be straightforward Java classes with annotation embedded to aid in dependency injection. For example, service implementations must have @Service annotation to help with Spring Boot auto-wiring support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is a need to communicate with external systems for data Spring Integration framework [7] could be used to avoid high coupling and low cohesion between various elements of the software under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;event-types&quot;&gt;2)  Event Types&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POJOs to facilitate Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern [8]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domain-model-converters&quot;&gt;3)  Domain Model Converters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Java Generics, a domain model converter takes one or more (collections) persistence domain models and converts them to models that are more appropriate for UI presentation aspects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;content-management&quot;&gt;4)  Content Management&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/content-management.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a--cma&quot;&gt;a)  CMA&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content Management Application (CMA) services would provide the building blocks for creating and publishing content for the websites. CMA would make use of NoSQL document stores such as MongoDB to store and retrieve content using Spring Data MongoDB framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b--cda&quot;&gt;b)  CDA&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content Delivery Application (CDA) services would provide the building blocks for retrieving content from the NoSQL document store. Spring Data REST and Spring HATEOAS would be primarily employed by this package to deliver JSON output using Jackson Data Bind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;e--data-layer&quot;&gt;E.  Data Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/data-layer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This layer shall use Spring Data primarily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domain-models&quot;&gt;1)  Domain Models&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POJOs annotated with @Entity (javax.persistence.*) when using Spring Data JPA [9] or QueryDSL [10]. When using NoSQL document stores, use Spring Data MongoDB [11].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components using Spring Data REST [12] would have appropriate “Entity Link” objects for JSON output processing using Jackson Data Bind [13].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;f--data-sources&quot;&gt;F.  Data Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/data-sources.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional databases with SQL support and NoSQL document stores could be employed to manage data for the websites. Corporate data such as Customer records and their relationships could be captured using the traditional databases such as Oracle or MySQL DBMS. Website content, that is unstructured in nature, could be stored in the NoSQL document stores such as MongoDB [14].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;g--external-systems&quot;&gt;G.  External Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems that are not directly developed to handle the websites would be considered external and therefore be accessed with “Integration Patterns” [15] in mind. Spring Integration framework provides implementations using POJOs for most of the architectural patterns such as endpoint, aggregator, filter, transformer, control bus [7] etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h--crosscutting-concerns&quot;&gt;H.  Crosscutting Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This partition is responsible for providing support for all layers in terms of security, tests, and operational management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/crosscutting-concerns.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-management&quot;&gt;1)  Operational Management&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot [16] will be used to simplify the bootstrapping and development of the websites. All configuration information must be captured using Java Configuration classes annotated with @Configuration and @Profile as opposed to using XML configurations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auditing, trace, health, and metrics of the websites can be customized using the Spring Boot Actuator module [17].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Database Migrations can be accomplished by Flyway database migration tool [18].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;2)  Security&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Security [19] to be utilized as a server side framework along with HDIV [20]. Since there is an enterprise solution in this area, a decision in this area will be detailed out at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tests&quot;&gt;3)  Tests&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit, Acceptance and Integration tests for the server-side components will be developed using (browser test automation and specification frameworks) Spock [21], Geb [22] in Groovy [1]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i--summary&quot;&gt;I.  Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following picture depicts all layers with interactions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/tech-stack.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii-software-development-process&quot;&gt;II. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology stack for the various areas of the software development process is outlined in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a--project-management&quot;&gt;A.  Project Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basecamp, Pivotal Tracker [23], and MS Project would be used as project management tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;b--integrated-development-environment-ide&quot;&gt;B.  Integrated Development Environment (IDE)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ IDEA [24] or Spring STS [25] would be used to develop code structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c--code-version-management&quot;&gt;C.  Code Version Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git [26] and GitHub [27] would be used as the version control system and remote private code repository respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d--build--dependency-management&quot;&gt;D.  Build &amp;amp; Dependency Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradle [28] would be used as the polyglot build and dependency management tool. Spring IO platform [29]  must be used in the build.gradle file to control the versions of the dependencies of Spring framework packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;e--code-quality-management-aka-automated-code-reviews&quot;&gt;E.  Code Quality Management aka. Automated Code Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code quality will be determined in terms of coding standards, overly complex and inefficient code, potential bugs, and bad coding practices. CheckStyle [30], PMD [31], CodeNarc [32] for Groovy [1], FingBugs [33], and JDepend [34] would be used to measure the code quality metrics. JaCoCo [35] would be used to measure code coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SonarQube [36] would be used to visualize, aggregate, and monitor code quality metrics over a period of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;f--artifact-assembly-and-publishing&quot;&gt;F.  Artifact Assembly and Publishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the need arises, JFrog Artifactory [37] or Sonatype Nexus [38] would be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;g--continuous-integration&quot;&gt;G.  Continuous Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins [39] would be used as the continuous integration [40] server to automate the stages in build pipeline as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/cd-ci-pipeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Application Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User Acceptance Test (UAT) and Production stages would be triggered manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii----conclusion&quot;&gt;III.    CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper discussed a wide range of technologies to develop and manage  websites efficiently. Though the technologies put forth in this paper will fit the application architecture and the development process, it is strongly recommended for the development team to be always on the lookout for better technology elements and incorporate them as it sees fit as the architecture emerges naturally as the website development efforts move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Though the Spring Projects make our lives easier on a daily basis, as a development lead, I do face technical difficulties in bridging the gap between development and operations. One such difficulty was to get one of my applications developed using a wide variety of Spring technnologies - Spring Data JPA, Spring Data Rest, Spring Hateoas, and Spring Data Redis - to deploy on WebSphere Application Server. I was excited to use Spring Boot 1.1.4 and Spring IO Platform 1.0.1 to manage my development and version management.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed my dev time every day until it was time to deploy the application on IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS). Expecting the Operations team to troubleshoot the deployment problems may not even be possible given the human resource availability/constraints on that team. Therefore, it becomes an additional development story within a Sprint (in Agile Scrum parlance) for the core dev team to execute.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploying-on-websphere-liberty-profile-wlp&quot;&gt;Deploying on WebSphere Liberty Profile (WLP)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial idea was to get the application up and running within WLP. You can download the runtime &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-non-eclipse-environments/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of struggle, I got WLP working within my IntelliJ IDE as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/WLP-in-IntelliJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;WLP in IntelliJ&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the &lt;code&gt;server.xml&lt;/code&gt; should look somewhat like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;server description=&amp;quot;new server&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- Enable features --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;featureManager&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;feature&amp;gt;localConnector-1.0&amp;lt;/feature&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;feature&amp;gt;jsp-2.2&amp;lt;/feature&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/featureManager&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- To access this server from a remote client add a host attribute to the following element, e.g. host=&amp;quot;*&amp;quot; --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;httpEndpoint httpPort=&amp;quot;9080&amp;quot; httpsPort=&amp;quot;9443&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;defaultHttpEndpoint&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;applicationMonitor updateTrigger=&amp;quot;mbean&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;jspEngine jdkSourceLevel=&amp;quot;16&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;application id=&amp;quot;Gradle___ContentRestServices___ncrs_war__exploded_&amp;quot; location=&amp;quot;/Users/Naru/IdeaProjects/ContentRestServices/out/artifacts/ContentRestServices/exploded/ncrs.war&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;Gradle___ContentRestServices___ncrs_war__exploded_&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;war&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/server&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Spring Boot starter package for web &lt;code&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/code&gt; uses embedded tomcat by default, I ended up specifying the following in my &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; file as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
providedRuntime(&quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;providedRuntime&lt;/code&gt; directive makes sure that the war plugin moves the embeeded tomcat jar files to &lt;code&gt;/WEB-INF/lib-provided&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;/WEB-INF/lib&lt;/code&gt; directory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The premise of Spring Boot is to develop and run Spring applications as standalones - extremely good for development teams. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you build the war file Without the above directive, the embedded tomcat jars will also be placed along with the other jar dependencies in the &lt;code&gt;/WEB-INF/lib&lt;/code&gt; directory. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/1194&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the question I posed to the Spring Boot team to get my application war file to work in a regular Tomcat or WLP environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the above situation with the application war file was fixed, my application deployed and ran fine within the WLP environment. After successfully getting the application to work in WLP environment, I moved onto deploying it in my test WAS 8.5.5.2 environment. To my surpise, the application did not even deploy properly. I had to perform a bunch of steps to get my REST application to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploying-on-websphere-application-server-was&quot;&gt;Deploying on WebSphere Application Server (WAS)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a successful deployment of Spring Boot applications in WAS is to setup a shared library as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/WAS-shared-library-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shared Library Setup in WAS&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I removed all the jar files under &lt;code&gt;/WEB-INF/lib&lt;/code&gt;  from my war file and placed them into the shared library. After setting up the shared library, I changed the class loader order as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/class-loader-order.png&quot; alt=&quot;Class Loader Order&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the application started, I got hit with JPA persistence issues as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: com.ibm.websphere.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl incompatible with javax.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider
    at javax.persistence.Persistence$1.isLoaded(Persistence.java:92) ~[hibernate-jpa-2.0-api-1.0.1.Final.jar:1.0.1.Final]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ClassCastException: com.ibm.websphere.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exception is due to the JPA 2.0 jars that are shipped with WAS 8.5.5.2. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a way to fix the issue by changing out the default java persistence API as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/alternate-persistence-provider-in-WAS.png&quot; alt=&quot;Persistence Provider&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Spring Boot 1.1.4 and starter package &lt;code&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&lt;/code&gt; contains hibernate JPA 2.1 support, it will collide with the JPA 2.0 jars that ship with WAS 8.5.5.2. There is no quick way to make WAS load your jar files through class loader order &lt;code&gt;PARENT_LAST&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could get the Spring Boot with JPA application to work was to downgrade hibernate jars to version &lt;code&gt;hibernate-release-4.2.15.Final&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/ithub-part-5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the configuration and administration aspects of itHUB a little more in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c---anticipatory-service-models&quot;&gt;C.   Anticipatory Service Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding the customer more and more, itHUB can evolve from being an interactive model for providing products and services to anticipatory model for offering products and services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/anticipatory-service-models.png&quot; alt=&quot;Anticipatory Service Models&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anticipatory Service Manager (ASM) component could be built using a combination of the event-driven architecture model and the prediction API described in the previous section. In the event-driven model, ASM will look for a predetermined set of events such as the New Hire event from PeopleSoft. Upon receiving the event, ASM will create the appropriate requests for the new hire. Some of the requests that can be submitted for a new hire include desktop/laptop, smart phone, any business unit specific applications etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;v----conclusion&quot;&gt;V.    CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article, distributed across 6 posts, discussed several techniques with which IT departments could transform from being a reactive informational IT shop to a more dynamic anticipatory service model where the IT department proactively caters to the IT needs of an organization. The first transformation from the more traditional informational model is to setup an online storefront – the itHUB.  itHUB is an implementation of the interactive model where customers interact with the system to submit, track, and approve/reject requests and service providers offer products and services through the system by administering request types.   To create and sustain the network effect, this article suggested the inclusion of wiki/blog, reviews &amp;amp; ratings, and Q&amp;amp;A features. The article also suggested some ways for implementing recommendation of products and services and sentiment analysis to improve the understanding of the IT customer. Finally, the ASM model was introduced to facilitate the need for making IT departments more agile and proactive.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/ithub-part-4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the configuration and administration aspects of itHUB a little more in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;g---request-management&quot;&gt;G.   Request Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component is about the configuration of request types and the processing of requests that are internal as well as destined for external service providers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;configuration-of-request-types&quot;&gt;1)  Configuration of Request Types&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, the cookie cutter request processing systems contain many unnecessary data fields (in the data collection forms) that are not pertinent to a request being made. Since those systems evolved over a period of time or COTS (Commercial Off-the-shelf) application with generic set of fields for all requests, they tend to offer poor user experience when it comes to request management. A Request Type in itHUB, on the other hand, represents a set of questions to be answered or data to be collected about a request prior to processing it. For example, before processing a request for a desktop, the IT support team must understand the requirement about the desktop request such as amount of RAM needed or number of CPUs needed etc. Therefore, a request type for desktops could be configured to just ask those questions that are pertinent for desktop requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/request-type-mgmt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;E-R Diagram for Request Type Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the above diagram, the request types can be categorized to support hardware requests, software requests, and application requests etc. A desktop request would be part of the hardware requests. By the same token, an external service provider’s offerings can also captured using this model. One of the ideas for presenting the various categories of request types are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/categories-of-request-types.png&quot; alt=&quot;Categories of Request Types&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request configuration enables the idea of grouping multiple request fields as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/desktop-request-with-two-field-groups.png&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop Request with two Field Groups&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;submission-of-requests&quot;&gt;2)  Submission of Requests&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the request types are defined, a customer could select a particular request for submission. The following E-R diagram shows one of way of implementing the decoupling of request configuration from the actual request itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/request-mgmt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Request Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h---approval-workflow&quot;&gt;H.   Approval Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each request type (e.g. Desktop Request) is configured with a set of approvers. One of the major constructs in the approval workflow component is the Approver Chain and is described in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;approver-chain&quot;&gt;1)  Approver Chain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Request Configuration (aka. Request Type) has a set of roles configured as an approver chain. For example, the desktop request has to be approved by the following roles: department manager and general manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/approval-workflow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Approval Workflow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;request-approval-status&quot;&gt;2)  Request Approval Status&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;The approval decision by each approver in the approver chain, approved or rejected, is captured in the Request Approval Status. The approver chain is configured as follows:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/approver-chain-configuration.png&quot; alt=&quot;Approver Chain Configuration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above scenario, the request will be sent to the department manager and then the general manager for approval. Depending upon the requestor of the request, the actual approvers are mapped to the roles and the workflow is initiated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/approval-routing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Approval Routing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;business-process-management-bpm&quot;&gt;3)  Business Process Management (BPM)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we introduce more products and services with varying degrees of workflow steps, it makes sense to start thinking about using a robust business process management engines such as JBoss Drools. By externalizing the business rules away from code, we can give a separate life cycle for rules to evolve more independently of the code. Another advantage to using a rules engine is to provide an opportunity for non-technical users to maintain the business rules without needing to contact a developer or the development team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i---web-layer&quot;&gt;I.   Web Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important layer for creating a memorable experience for our customers. In addition to the traditional web application to submit, track, approve, and administer the requests, this layer must also provide support for managing wiki/blogs, ratings and reviews, and questions and answers (Q&amp;amp;A). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-submit-track-approve-and-administer-requests&quot;&gt;a) Submit, Track, Approve, and Administer Requests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the crux of itHUB. This is one of the main reasons as to why customers come to itHUB in the fist place - an easy to use web interface where customers and service providers (aka. service administrators) come together to make the request management possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/itHUB-request-management-usecases.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request management Use-cases&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;submit-use-case&quot;&gt;(1)   Submit Use-Case&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;itHUB customers choose from a set of request types, provide details for the request, and submit the request as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/customer-chooses-a-request-for-submission.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request Submission&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/customer-submits-the-request-after-providing-details.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request with Customized Details&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;track-use-case&quot;&gt;(2)   Track Use-Case&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;itHUB customer wishes to know the status of his/her request. The status of the request can be submitted, in-review, approved, or rejected as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/track-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;Track View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;manage-use-case&quot;&gt;(3)   Manage Use-Case&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;itHUB approvers wish to perform approvals for a list of requests. Approval is a process by which the approver either approves or rejects a request based on the need – requester’s need in terms of the department’s overall need. The following screen capture shows the Manage view of one of the department managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/manage-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;Manage View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;administer-use-case&quot;&gt;(4)   Administer Use-Case&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service providers and service administrators create a portfolio products and services for the itHUB customers to choose and request from. As described in the previous sections, each request type has the following data structure: request hub, request category, request, request field group, and request field configurations. A request hub holds on to multiple categories such as ITHUB to hold onto IT products and services. A request category holds onto multiple request configurations. Each request configuration holds onto multiple field groups and a field group holds to multiple request fields. As shown in the following screen capture, a service provider/administrator has appropriate rights to create hid/her portfolio of products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/request-type-administration.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request Type Administration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example view of the request configurations is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/request-configuration-administration-view.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request Configuration Administration View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the same token, other request type components could be administered using the appropriate administration views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b-q--a&quot;&gt;b) Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major components of the web layer is the question and answers (Q&amp;amp;A) web component. By integrating the Q&amp;amp;A web component, itHUB will be able to create the network effect as described in the previous sections. Instead of building a homegrown solution for the Q&amp;amp;A web component, IT departments could consider COTS applications such as Open Source Q&amp;amp;A (OSQA) or its commercial equivalent AnswerHub. AnswerHub is a cloud-based knowledge management system built on a Q&amp;amp;A foundation [12].  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/question-and-answer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Q&amp;amp;A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;c-wikiblogs&quot;&gt;c) Wiki/Blogs&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding wiki/blog support to itHUB is relatively easy. It makes sense to pursue a COTS application for wikis/blogs as opposed to building a homegrown solution. There are several wiki/blog software are available either standalone or on the cloud – Atlassian Confluence, WordPress are only a few. Picking one and integrating it into itHUB shouldn’t be difficult. The idea behind wiki/blog is to promote product/service awareness from both service-provider’s and customer’s POVs. An example blog is shown below from the Atlassian Blog website [13].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/idea-for-blog-implementation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Idea for Blog Implementation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iv---understanding-the-customer&quot;&gt;IV.   UNDERSTANDING THE CUSTOMER&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As IT departments add more products and services, there must be a way to show products and services that are absolutely required by the business unit and its people. The other need for IT departments is to understand how the customers feel about the products and services. The following sections will attempt to illustrate some ideas for providing relevant product and service recommendations and understanding customers using sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a---productsservices-recommendation&quot;&gt;A.   Products/Services Recommendation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;itHUB can improve customer experience by recommending products and services that are absolutely essential for customers based on their roles within the business unit, projects that they are part of, and their involvement at the organizational activities.  There are several prediction API frameworks available in the market. itHUB could incorporate predictions to recommend the most relevant products and services to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;b---sentiment-analysis&quot;&gt;B.   Sentiment Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment Analysis models could help IT departments to analyze text data in user generated content such as product/service reviews, blogs, comments, and Q&amp;amp;A and classify the sentiments as positive or negative to further improve the services offered. One of the predictions API is Google’s Prediction API (GPA). GPA could be setup to analyze and classify the text data in seven steps as follows [14]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Label your data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare your data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the data to Google cloud storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Train your model with GPA&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make predictions with GPA in itHUB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update your model with new data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue by discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/ithub-part-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the application integration aspects of itHUB a little more in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;e---external-service-providers-products-and-services-integration&quot;&gt;E.   External Service Provider’s Products and Services Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section will discuss the integration of Walmart’s products and services to itHUB using the Walmart Data Feed API [10].  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-integration&quot;&gt;1)  Data Integration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a list of items by category, we have to register with the Walmart Open API and acquire an apiKey. Once the apiKey is acquired, there are several methods available to retrieve items as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lookup API&lt;/strong&gt; - Get Items - /v1/items/id&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taxonomy API&lt;/strong&gt; - Get Taxonomy - /v1/taxonomy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search API&lt;/strong&gt; - Get Search - /v1/search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-data-semantics&quot;&gt;a) Data Semantics&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart’s product data semantics is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

        &amp;quot;availableOnline&amp;quot;: true
    }
]}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;process-integration&quot;&gt;2)  Process Integration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-interface-process&quot;&gt;a) Interface Process&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requestor of the data feed will make a call as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/walmart-interface-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;Walmart Interface Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Request Management component needs a translator service to enable the processing of product data to and from Walmart API services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b-workflow&quot;&gt;b) Workflow&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the attributes, productUrl, shown in the JSON code block, represents the deep linked URL that directly links to the product page of the item on walmart.com, and uniquely identifies the affiliate (itHUB in this case) sending this request via a linkshare tracking id |LSNID| [11]. In this case, the ordering process with the external service provider can be as simple as a link-out to the deep linked web page on the Walmart.com website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;application-integration&quot;&gt;3)  Application Integration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To seamlessly integrate with the request management component as described in the previous section, the products and services data from the external service providers such as Walmart and Staples have to be translated to and from the itHUB product and service vocabulary. One of the methods of implementation design is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/ithub-application-integration-with-external-service-providers.png&quot; alt=&quot;itHUB Application Integration with External Service Providers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-walmart-product-mapper&quot;&gt;a) Walmart Product Mapper&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of the Product Mapper is to extract all the necessary attributes from the “item” response XML/JSON string and create an itHUB-compatible external product item that can be represented using a common web interface. By the same token, for item inquiry or item order details, the mapper will convert the “Request” to Walmart API specific item specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b-ithub-walmart-gateway&quot;&gt;b) itHUB Walmart Gateway&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of the Walmart Gateway is to receive and submit the product data from and to the Walmart Open API. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;f---user-management&quot;&gt;F.   User Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the previous section, to create a singular view about the customer, itHUB user management component might have to assemble the information from a wide variety of data sources – user directory, ERP systems such as SAP, employee management software systems such as PeopleSoft to name a few. The following entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows a simplistic implementation of some of the attributes needed to properly service customers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/user-management.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;User Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pull customer-related information from multiple data sources, the following design could be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/user-management-integration.png&quot; alt=&quot;E-R Diagram for User Management Integration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;repository&quot;&gt;1)  Repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of the repository is to encapsulate storage, retrieval, and search behavior and to emulate a collection of objects (Evans, 2003).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-erp-repository&quot;&gt;a) ERP Repository&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a specialized implementation of the Repository to deal with ERP systems and can be further specialized to deal with a specific ERP system – e.g. SAP Repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b-user-repository&quot;&gt;b) User Repository&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a specialized implementation of the Repository to extract user details of customers from a user store such as an Active Directory. This can also be further specialized to deal with specific user stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-service&quot;&gt;2)  User Service&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of the User Service is to retrieve and assemble user details, billing details etc. from a wide variety of repositories described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/ithub-part-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the software architecture of itHUB a little more in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c---technology-web-20-and-beyond&quot;&gt;C.   Technology: Web 2.0 and Beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;The use of Web 2.0 and beyond [9] is a must for the itHUB platform. The following diagram illustrates the architectural layers and partitions of itHUB platform software components:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/layers-and-Partitions-of-itHUB.png&quot; alt=&quot;Layers and Partitions of itHUB&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internal-products-and-services&quot;&gt;1)  Internal Products and Services&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These products and services are the core competencies of the IT departments. These products and services could range from homegrown applications to hardware and software bundles that the IT departments have direct control over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ithub-data-store&quot;&gt;2)  itHUB Data Store&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a dedicated data store to itHUB platform for the purposes of storing and retrieving its constructs such as “requests”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;external-products-and-services&quot;&gt;3)  External Products and Services&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are from the external service providers such as Walmart, Staples and PC Connection – a select set of products and services that conform to the standards and compliance needs of the IT organization.
The products and services from the external service providers will be accessed using their application interfaces (API) and added to the internal products and services to create the consolidated portfolio of products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;request-management&quot;&gt;4)  Request Management&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Request Management is the crux of the itHUB platform as shown in Figure 7. Requests are managed in two steps as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure/Provide Request Types – Either the service providers or the service administrator carries out this step. This is the first step in making a set of requests available to the IT customers to choose from and ultimately requested for. These are configurations or specifications of the requests and not the requests themselves. For example, to process a desktop request, the IT department might need a set of data points such as “Is this a new or replacement desktop?” or “How much RAM is required?” etc. Without these values, processing of the desktop request may not be possible. 
Plus, the list of approvers is specified for each of the request type. For example, for a desktop request, there may be a need for approvals from the department manager and the general manager (or some suitable roles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/request-management.png&quot; alt=&quot;Request Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create/Track Requests – After choosing one of the request types, for example, the desktop request, the customer goes on to fill out the necessary data points and submits the request. Once the request is submitted, it is routed for approvals based on the specification of the request type. As described in the previous section, a desktop request will be routed to the department manager and the general manager of the customer who submitted the request. After submitting the request, the customer could check on the status of the request including the approvals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;approval-workflow&quot;&gt;5)  Approval Workflow&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in the above picture, the approval workflow enables the management team to ensure that the requested products or services are really a need for the requestor’s job role. One of the primary steps of this component is described below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approve/Reject Requests – In this step, requests are either approved or rejected by the approvers. Email/SMS channels will be utilized to send and receive approval notices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-management&quot;&gt;6)  User Management&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the customer data is managed. As described in the previous sections, customer data includes location information such as address, building, and floor details, billing information in terms of cost center, project number or internal order number etc., and the department information including manager details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;user-management-store&quot;&gt;7)  User Management Store&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data points about the customer needed to process requests successfully might spread across multiple data stores and ERP systems. There may be a need to assemble the customer data from a wide variety of data sources such as PeopleSoft, Asset management database, LDAP directories to create a unified view of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;erp&quot;&gt;8)  ERP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) might house the relevant billing information for itHUB to associate with customers and their requests. As described in the previous section, the billable information could include cost center, project number or internal order number for cross charging purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;web-layer&quot;&gt;9)  Web Layer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web layer would include components such as wiki/blog creation framework, web application frameworks such as J2EE-based Spring framework for web site navigation development, data persistence, web service development, and for messaging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d---ithub--the-system-boundary&quot;&gt;D.   itHUB – The System Boundary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram illustrates the system boundary and the dependencies of itHUB with external systems both managed by the IT department and external service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/ithub-system-boundary.png&quot; alt=&quot;itHUB System Boundary&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the diagram, the user infrastructure could be a combination of systems such as PeopleSoft, corporate LDAP directory etc. The billing information such as cost center details could be housed in ERP systems such as SAP. Therefore, the user management component has to deal with assembling a unified view of the customer. The request management component has to deal with receiving and processing the external service provider’s product data. 
The following section will go over the data semantics and formats for enabling the integration of customer data with internal to IT, but external to itHUB and exchanging products and services from external suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/ithub-part-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the interactive model and the need for itHUB a little more in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii--interactive-model&quot;&gt;III.  INTERACTIVE MODEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interactive model, the IT departments provide an e-business platform with a unified web interface to search, submit, track IT requests for their customers. The platform will also provide facilities for service providers to deliver on the requests in terms of ordering items and updating the details of the requests across multiple systems. In addition to the above requirements, the platform should also provide ways in which an IT customer can pose questions and get answers either from the other IT customers or from an IT service provider. The remainder of the article will refer to such an e-business platform as itHUB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a---ithub--the-platform&quot;&gt;A.   itHUB – The Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;A two-sided platform [3] is a good starting point for itHUB. There are consumers that will request for services, check for statuses, post questions and/or answers, write blog articles, and rate the quality of services offered. There are service providers – IT departments – that fulfill requests. There are approvers – typically, managers of requestors – to approve requests made by their department users, so that the service providers can fulfill them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/two-sided-ithub-platform.png&quot; alt=&quot;2-sided itHUB Platform&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to IT departments, service providers can also be external vendors such as Walmart, Staples etc. Both platform provider and the sponsor could be the IT organization in question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;platform-sponsor-vs-platform-provider&quot;&gt;1)  Platform Sponsor vs. Platform Provider&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the itHUB platform is built with enough abstraction, there is a possibility for IT organizations to repurpose itHUB so that it could be used as a service delivery platform for other departments. For example, a car manufacturer’s employee sales department could make use of the itHUB platform to fulfill car requests. In this particular case, the IT department will become the platform sponsor and the employee sales department will become the platform provider. The following section describes the network effects in itHUB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-network-effects&quot;&gt;2)  The Network Effects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network effect is the effect that one customer of the IT products or services has on the value of those products or services to other consumers [4].  The itHUB platform will benefit from having such network effects as shown in the next picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-same-side-network-effect&quot;&gt;a) Same-side Network Effect&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer-to-Customer Network effect&lt;/em&gt; is positive since more customers make IT products and services better. This is possible because of the interactions among the customers through social questions and answers and wikis/blogs. The more customers pose questions/answers and write blog articles about the IT products and services for clarification and usage scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/network-effect.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Network Effect&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Provider-to-Service Provider Network&lt;/em&gt; Effect is negative as increased competition makes itHUB less attractive to external service providers such as Walmart, Staples, and PC Connection etc. The same-side network effect among internal IT service providers is positive as the internal IT departments work with each other to deliver on the IT requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b-cross-side-network-effect&quot;&gt;b) Cross-side Network Effect&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer-to-Service Provider Network Effect&lt;/em&gt; is positive as more customers attract more external service providers. 
&lt;em&gt;Service Provider-to-Customer Network Effect&lt;/em&gt; is positive as more service providers attract more customers as the perceived speed of delivery of IT products and services by the customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;c-ideas-for-creating-and-sustaining-the-network-effect&quot;&gt;c) Ideas for creating and sustaining the Network Effect&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT service management is often considered a one-time deal where customers are thought to come to IT for services and go away until another need arises. Though this is true, there is an opportunity for IT departments to create a loyal customer base where not only the IT support team but also the application teams can hear about the voices of the customers in terms of application user interface design, development, and deployment. This feedback loop is valuable in terms of designing applications for the better in the future. 
By creating an integrated e-business platform where not only IT requests are easier to create, submit, and track, but also providing a way for the customers to receive a fast, accurate, and friendly answers [5]. In this case, it is not just the IT support team that is responsible, but the entire community of IT customers and the service providers bears the responsibility of helping each other. As long as the platform is easy to use, reaching the critical mass, unlike in a public social platform, should not be a problem for IT departments since IT customers are the employees of the organization where IT departments are a part.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to external IT service providers such as Walmart, Staples, PC Connection etc., the platform has to ensure that the “winner-takes-all” scenario does not exist [6]. This can be easily mitigated with a procurement policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section discusses a couple of digital business models that the IT departments could adapt to further sustaining the network effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;b---the-digital-business-model&quot;&gt;B.   The Digital Business Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT could employ the Click-and-Mortar (C&amp;amp;M) business model [7] where it maintains a web storefront in addition to its physical office space. IT must exercise the Infomediary model [7] to facilitate transactions between the consumers and the external service providers such as Walmart, Staples, PC Connection etc. To facilitate the social interactions among its customers and the service providers, IT could employ the Community model [7]. 
Each business model – C&amp;amp;M, Infomediary, and Community – can be implemented in terms of content, customer experience, and the platform [8] and built into itHUB as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/components-of-the-digital-business-model.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Components of the Digital Business Model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;1) Content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product/Service information.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;IT related products and services information include description, images and videos, price, policies, and procedures for hardware, software, and applications offered by the IT department.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;External service provider catalog.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;This requires an integration of itHUB with the external service provider’s e-catalog and order placement solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Questions and Answers
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Questions and answers could also be posted by IT personnel in addition to being posted by the customers (user-generated)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Questions and answers are related to the products and services offered by the IT department and the external service providers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IT Product/Service related wikis and blog articles
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HOW-TO articles describing the usage of a particular hardware, software, or applications with images and videos
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;For example, virus outbreaks and mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;customer-experience&quot;&gt;2)  Customer Experience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy-to-use
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To create and sustain the network effect as described in the previous section, itHUB has to employ good usability guidelines
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;For example, 1-click request submission when the customer profile is completely known&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;If the customer is a new hire, allow ways in which multiple related items could be ordered in one request
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;This is an example of a composite request where several individual requests are added to one parent request&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shopping cart
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;itHUB must provide a way to instruct the customers regarding the number of items and the prices that they are about to request&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There should be a way to save a set of items for later submission&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There should be a way to save and send a set of items for a different customer to submit the order&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cost center / Project-based billing
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;itHUB must have access to the billing information of the customer to facilitate ordering price-based items&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Messaging 
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Email/SMS acknowledgement
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Whenever a request is placed and until the request is completely satisfied, itHUB must notify the requestor regularly through emails or text messages&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Alerts 
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Notify the requestor whenever approval/rejection workflow is carried out&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer generated Content
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ratings and reviews
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Provide a way for customers to rate/review the products and services they received
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;This is an important feedback mechanism by which IT departments can and will learn about the products and services they are offering&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Sentiment Analysis can be carried out on the reviews to figure out the satisfaction levels of customers&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Questions and Answers (Q&amp;amp;A)
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A is a great way to create the network effect described in the previous section&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detailed history of requests
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a great way to promulgate the amount of work IT has done to its customers, business units, and the entire organization&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Keeping track of the detailed history of requests along with comments, ratings, reviews etc. will provide IT an opportunity to infer the seasonality, satisfaction levels of customers, improvement needs among others&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tailored recommendations based on the customer profile or the business unit 
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This feature is a differentiator in which the itHUB will be perceived as a platform that understands the needs of its customers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;platform&quot;&gt;3)  Platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internal components
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Customer data
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Address along with location, building, and floor&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Customer’s position or title and department
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;To facilitate the approval process, the customer’s title is important&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Customer Billing Information
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Cost center, inter order number, project number are some of the attributes that are needed to be captured for the purposes of billing the customer&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;External components
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shipment of physical products to remote locations using UPS, FedEx etc.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;In a geographically separated organizations, IT must take shipment of items to respective business units into account&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Product and Services data from external service providers such as Walmart, Staples, and PC Connection
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;This is the crux of enabling B2B commerce with the external service providers&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Information Technology (IT) departments spend so much time and effort in providing products and services to their organizations. Oftentimes, by being caught up in the support mode, IT departments do not spend the time to supplement their support services using a well-defined online storefront. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the online forms to gather information about the IT service requests are either cumbersome for business users or archaic to lend themselves to submit, track, and administer requests from a single point of entry on the web. The purpose of this article is to build an online storefront – itHUB – an easy-to-use online destination for IT consumers to submit and track their hardware, software, and application requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i---introduction&quot;&gt;I.   INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;IT must evolve from providing an informational outlet for its services into providing interactive and anticipatory models of service management. 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/it-service-mgmt-evolution.png&quot; alt=&quot;IT Service Management Evolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following sections will illustrate the need for such an evolution by describing the problems/issues found in each of the models and some of the ways in which they can be improved/eradicated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii--informational-model&quot;&gt;II.  INFORMATIONAL MODEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the informational model, IT departments maintain a set of web pages or a set of MS Word/PDF documents to collect information about the request. Oftentimes, the collected information is then processed either manually or by using disparate systems – a type of system for approval and another for fulfilling the request. The following section describes the ways in which the IT requests are processed and the weaknesses found in the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a---request-processing&quot;&gt;A.   Request Processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;The following diagram illustrates the various steps involved in processing IT requests in the informational model-based IT departments:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/typical-IT-request-processing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typical IT Request processing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;submit-request&quot;&gt;1)  Submit Request&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT customer performs this step. It could be as easy as filling out a web form, printing and filling out a MS Word/PDF document or as difficult as making several phone calls or writing several emails to find out as to which web form to use or which MS Word/PDF document to fill out for the request. In some cases, a proper form of request submission might not even exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analyze-request&quot;&gt;2)  Analyze Request&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the IT support center or Help Desk performs this step. IT help desk personnel will carefully review the submitted request and send it back to the IT customer if more information is needed to process the request further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;route-request&quot;&gt;3)  Route Request&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the IT support center or Help Desk performs this step. Depending upon the request, there may be a need to get multiple approvals from department manager, general manager among other management team members. Routing request could also be done to get some type of verification from the subject matter expert (SME) who will end up satisfying the request upon approval. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;process-approvals&quot;&gt;4)  Process Approvals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the IT support center or Help Desk performs this step. It is also possible for IT service providers to perform this step as well. There may be a need to include additional approvers before satisfying the request. For example, a request for a network share might require an additional approval from the owner of the share in addition to the approvals from the management team. This step is performed to ensure that the request is a legitimate need from the IT customer to perform his/her job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deliver-on-request&quot;&gt;5)  Deliver on Request&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either the IT service provider or the IT help desk performs this step. For example, the IT help desk (or a similar department within IT) would most probably satisfy requests for hardware items whereas the IT service provider might need to involve its SMEs to get the application properly installed and configured on the IT customer’s computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;order-item&quot;&gt;6)  Order Item&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either the IT service provider or the IT help desk performs this step. If the request involves items that are not readily available, the item has to be ordered from external vendors/service providers. There may be a need to involve the purchasing/procurement division of the organization that the IT department is a part of. This step might take from a few days to several weeks or months depending upon the price tag of the item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update-details&quot;&gt;7)  Update Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the IT support center or Help Desk performs this step. Depending upon the type of request, the help desk personnel might have to update several systems such as asset tracking system, request management system, procurement system etc. Oftentimes, these systems capture either the same or different details about the request and its outcome.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;b---weaknesses-of-the-informational-model&quot;&gt;B.   Weaknesses of the Informational Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the above section, this model is only concerned with providing information to facilitate the submission of IT requests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;higher-search-and-information-costs&quot;&gt;1)  Higher Search and Information Costs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the search and information costs [1][2] associated with locating the correct IT request type for submission are high. For example, a new hire might require a wide variety of hardware, software, and organization-specific applications to be productive in his/her role in supporting the business goals of the organization. 
Finding and submitting requests with relevant details mandated by those request types could take days or weeks for the new hire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the bare minimum requirements such as user id creation within the corporate directory for the new hire might have to be submitted by another team member who is already in the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-lack-of-user-community&quot;&gt;a) Lack of user community&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason for the higher search and information costs associated with this model is because of the centralized dispersal of information regarding the IT requests. All requests are directed to IT irrespective of their criticality. Oftentimes, the IT personnel are exhausted answering the same questions repeatedly. Without a streamlined process for facilitating questions and answers, the IT department wastes time answering common questions instead of catering to real requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;higher-policing-and-enforcement-costs&quot;&gt;2)  Higher Policing and Enforcement Costs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the request processing section, steps 2, 3, and 4 are highly time consuming in terms of coordination of the approval efforts between IT and the business units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;higher-integration-costs&quot;&gt;3)  Higher Integration Costs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in steps 6 and 7, there could be 2 or more data repositories where the details of the requests are kept. As the number of systems, where the details of the requests are kept, increase, the integration costs go up significantly in terms of data, application, and process integration efforts. For example, the IT customer profile information, for the purposes of satisfying IT requests, must include location of the customer in terms of building and floor information. Otherwise, tracking the location of the customer during the delivery of a hardware item must be sought out manually. This is especially difficult if the organization is spread across multiple geographical locations. Oftentimes, the IT customer information is kept in the employee management systems such as PeopleSoft and it is not kept up to date in terms of the IT customer’s location information. As described in step 6, when there is a need to order items, there is also a need for billing information in terms of the cost center, internal order number or project number that the cost of the item has to be cross-charged with. Once an item has been purchased, it becomes an asset of the organization and therefore needs to be tracked for depreciation etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c---moving-up-the-evolution-chain&quot;&gt;C.   Moving up the Evolution Chain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, the amount of information needed to deliver on an IT request quickly adds up. In this informational model, the majority of the integration work is done manually and therefore, the model is neither cost effective nor efficient in managing information across multiple systems. It is absolutely essential for the IT department to move up the service management evolution chain and adopt the interactive model as described in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the Penetration Tests for the Cloud Environment in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;d--penetration-tests-for-the-cloud-environment&quot;&gt;D.  Penetration Tests for the Cloud Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penetration tests (Pen-tests), in this context, mean a set of methods to evaluate the security of the web application by simulating attacks against it before and after deploying the application on the public cloud. By testing the application for vulnerabilities before deploying the application on the cloud, we know how secure the web application is against those attacks. This will help set the baseline. By testing the web application after deploying it on the cloud, we can compare against the baseline to determine whether the cloud environment needs to be tweaked further or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black, white, and gray box testing methods enable the security team and/or the development team with assessing the security posture of the web application [29]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;black-box-testing&quot;&gt;1)  Black Box Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This testing method does not assume that the performer of these tests know the inner workings of the web applications in terms of its architecture, design, and code structures employed. When testing Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) applications, employing a set of black box testing methods such as the use of automated scanning tools and manual penetration tests would help the team in assessing the security posture of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;white-box-testing&quot;&gt;2)  White Box Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This testing method assumes that the performer of the tests know the inner workings of the web application in terms of its architecture and design. It also assumes that the performer of the test has access to the source code of the web application. Tests such as static code analysis, code crawlers, and debuggers are employed in this type of testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gray-box-testing&quot;&gt;3)  Gray Box Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This testing method combines the strength of both black and white box-testing methods and assumes that the performer of the test has a little background of the web application in terms of architecture and design aspects and has access to the source code of the application. For example, taking the amount of external frameworks used to build the web application these days – ESAPI for security, “Spring” framework for presentation and data layers etc. – the development team and the security team know only a portion of the web application. Therefore, employing gray box testing methods make a lot of sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;selecting-a-testing-framework&quot;&gt;4)  Selecting a testing framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection of one method over another depends the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time allocated to the Pen-test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to architecture, design, and code structures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Availability of the security experts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Goals of the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the short-term effects of attackers with limited resources, the performer could decide to employ black box testing methods. On the other hand, to study the long-term effects of attackers with significant resources, the performer could decide to employ the gray box testing methods. Therefore, the selection really depends on the situation and the stipulated constraints as stated above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OWASP testing guide has defined ten different categories of penetration testing to find vulnerabilities in web applications as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information Gathering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configuration management Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business Logic Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authentication Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authorization Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Session Management Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Validation Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing for Denial of Service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web Services Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ajax Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security team could employ tools such as Kali Linux along with a whole host of security tools that come with it to successfully assess the security posture of the Web application. Kali Linux ships with a wide variety of security pen-test tools as shown in the screenshot below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/kali-linux.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kali Linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before using any of these toolkits, it is mandatory to seek the written authorization from the CISO and/or the CIO of the organization. These pen-tests have to be run under the direct supervision or guidance of the CISO and/or the CIO. In some cases, the cloud broker or the provider has to clear the tests if performed against the cloud installations. Since the use or misuse of some of these tools would most probably result in property damages including the modification and/or destruction of data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;v--conclusion&quot;&gt;V.  CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explored in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are several security implications to moving corporate web applications to the public cloud. There are threats like data breaches originating from the use of shared technology environments and multi-tenancy models of the cloud platform. At the same time, the public cloud-computing platform cannot be ignored due to a false sense of security. Therefore, employing a solid risk management framework such as the NIST’s Cloud Risk Management Framework (CRMF) helps in identifying risks and ultimately validating the selection of security components and controls for a given set of risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRMF along with the CSA’s Trusted Cloud Initiative Reference Architecture (TCI-RA) identify the cloud actors that are responsible for those security components/controls. The clear delineation of responsibilities enhances the cloud consumer’s transparency and results in crafting a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that would work for all the cloud agents in question.   One of the biggest responsibilities of a cloud consumer in moving to the public cloud is to inject “security” into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This secured SDLC (SSDLC) will enable the consumer to thwart security threats that originate at the application layer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employing security-focused stories and tasks enable an Agile Scrum team to pay a close attention to security aspects right from the Sprint planning to code implementation and testing.  The SAFECode guidelines will help the development, QA, and security teams in creating a SSDLC platform that would make the engineering of security-aware web applications possible. In addition to following a SSDLC constructs, the use of security frameworks such as ESAPI reduces the implementation time of the security controls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the web application is built according to specifications, black, white, and gray box testing methods could be performed to assess the security posture of the web application. Several open source tools such as Kali Linux could be used to successfully perform those testing methods. Before performing any of these types of penetration tests, it is mandatory to get the written authorization from the CISO and/or the CIO. In some cases, it is necessary to get authorization from the cloud agent as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the Secure Development Practices in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;c--employing-secure-development-practices&quot;&gt;C.  Employing Secure Development Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a set of security libraries to do input and output validation, error handling, authentication and authorization, session management, secure resource access, secure communications, and secure storage [26] will help implement several security controls when moving to the cloud. Using a standard library will help contain the proliferation of inconsistent security implementations across teams for some known vulnerabilities. For example, OWASP Java Encoder library [27] could be used to implement secure coding requirements such as input and output validation and combat against a whole host of vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection attacks etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;input-validation&quot;&gt;1)  Input Validation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers have to ensure that the data received is a valid input for the software component in question. There are four techniques to make sure that the data received is valid as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whitelisting input&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Using this technique, the developer defines a set of known input values. For example, a regular expression used for whitelisting an email address as input could be: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;Boolean isGoodEmail = Pattern.matches(email,”^([a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+)@(([[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.)|(([a-zA-Z0-9-]+.)+))([a-zA-Z]{2,4}|[0-9]{1,3})(]?)$”);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blacklisting input
Based on some known vulnerabilities, the developer could actively check for combinations of characters that are usually signs of cross-site scripting and remove them as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;String clean_input = bad_input.replaceAll(Pattern.quote(“’”));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Canonicalization of Input
Canonicalization is an operation by which the input (that could have been encoded by a malicious user to send scripts via input parameters) is reduced down to its simple form. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;String canonicalized_input = ESAPI.canonicalize(input);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encoding/Escaping of Input
OWASP has published a library of Java methods [27, 28] to successfully encode or escape input data so that the input doesn’t contain any commands/scripts in them. For example, to ensure that there is no SQL scripting in the input, one could use the ESAPI as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;String db_query_input = ESAPI.encodeForSQL(DB2_Codec, input);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code, by using the right codec for a database such as MySQLCodec, OracleCodec etc., the developer could potentially combat against SQL Injection Attacks. By maintaining a parameter-mapping table as shown below, a developer could apply necessary techniques to properly validate the input data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/parameter-specs-for-input-validation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Parameter Specs for Input Validation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;output-validation&quot;&gt;2)  Output Validation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-site scripting attacks originate through poorly validated output of a web application. Attackers often use this technique to orchestrate phishing attacks and extract valuable information from unsuspecting end user. Depending upon where the output is going to end up on a web page, developers have to choose the correct encoding technique. For example, if the output is going to end up as a URL, the output has to be encoded with URL special characters such as “?” and “&amp;amp;” etc. These characters have to be properly encoded with “%”. Once again, developers must start with a parameter table as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/parameter-specs-for-output-validation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Parameter Specs for Output Validation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using ESAPI (or a similar framework), encode the output as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;String safe_output_url = ESAPI.encodeForURL(output);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the same token, output destined to go within the body of the web page, use the following technique:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;String safe_output_html = ESAPI.encodeForHTML(output);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above technique, the “output” will be properly encoded to convert special HTML characters such as “&amp;lt;” to “&amp;lt;” etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, other than URL (PercentCodec) and HTML (HTMLCodec) encoding techniques, there are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScriptCodec, CSSCodec, and VBScriptCodec etc. to encode the output to go within a JavaScript, CSS, or VBScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a--why-do-we-need-to-do-input-validation-at-the-server-side&quot;&gt;a)  Why do we need to do input validation at the server side?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on client-side input validation is not recommended. By setting up a proxy such as WebScarab or BurpSuite etc., an attacker can easily bypass client-side validation completely as shown in the screenshot below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/modification-of-input-using-webscarab.png&quot; alt=&quot;Modification of Input using WebScarab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these client-side proxy tools, an attacker will be able modify the HTTP header variables, change the values of query parameters, and add new query parameters if necessary. Therefore, it is not enough to just rely on client-side validations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;error-handling&quot;&gt;3)  Error Handling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important step a developer has to pay special attention to. Attackers formulate and fine-tune their attack vectors by inducing error conditions and see how the web application reacts to those errors. When an error is not properly handled, oftentimes, the error message gets displayed on the web page. These error messages provide vital clues to the attackers as to the type of operating system, database, web server, application server, and authentication server that the web application uses or is built with. For example, ESAPI has several predefined exceptions that can be thrown and handled in the code. Some of the exceptions include EncodingException, IntrusionException, and EnterpriseSecurityException etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secure-storage&quot;&gt;4)  Secure Storage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the responsibility chart of various cloud actors, securing the storage of certain sensitive information such as password, credit card numbers, personal identification number (PIN) etc. falls under the cloud consumer’s responsibility. Therefore, the development team from the consumer side has to ensure that appropriate techniques such as one-way hashing, encryption of sensitive information are performed in an effective manner. There are several industrial strength cryptographic packages available such as Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE), Bouncy Castle etc. that the development team could easily incorporate into their code to enable secure storage of sensitive information on the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, ESAPI provides Java methods that enable users to either hash or encrypt sensitive information. The difference is that hashed information cannot be decrypted and is ideal for password storage. On the other hand, encrypted data can be decrypted using a key and this technique is useful for securing the other sensitive information such as credit card numbers etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;String hashed_password = ESAPI.hash(plaintext_password, salt);
String encrypted_credit_card = ESAPI.encrypt(plaintext_cc);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is interesting to note is the use of “salt” in the above hashing code. A salt is used as an additional input to a one-way hash function to strengthen the randomness of the resulting ciphertext. A good “salt” will combat against dictionary attacks and rainbow-table attacks. Since the hashes are randomized effectively by the use of the salt, the attackers are forced to change the dictionary/table constantly for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar technique must be employed to securely store property files. The property files are used in almost all of the layers and partitions of a web application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secure-communications&quot;&gt;5)  Secure Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web pages that take any type of sensitive information, as input must be sent over a secure communication layer such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or the Secured Socket Layer (SSL). When using SSL, the use of SSLv3 is recommended over SSLv2, as SSLv2 is not considered secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these security principles along with a pre-fabricated security library such as ESAPI [28], developers can exercise secure coding practices and successfully contribute towards implementing the security controls that the cloud consumer is responsible for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the Software Engineering for the PaaS Service Model in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;b--software-engineering-for-the-paas-service-model&quot;&gt;B.  Software Engineering for the PaaS Service Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software development environment has to lend itself to managing a wide variety of artifacts that emerge from a multitude of software life cycle management activities such as requirements management, change management, configuration management, build management, integration management, release management, and test management in the areas of define, design, code, test, and run [25]. In order to succeed in the security endeavor, there is a greater need to equip the development team with necessary software tools to enable complete tracing from requirements to code releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following diagram illustrates the overall development environment with tasks organized in terms of Development, QA, Automated, and Security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/software-engineering-for-paas-service-model.png&quot; alt=&quot;Software Engineering for PaaS Service Model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-aka-scrum-team-tasks&quot;&gt;1)  Development aka. Scrum Team Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/dev-team-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Product Owner creates user stories and epics in the Agile Requirements Management Server. Developers, Security experts, and the Scrum master break the user stories and epics into multiple tasks and assign appropriate estimates in terms of story points. One convention that the team could follow is to equate one story point to one ideal man-day – A day of development that can be done when there are no external distractions such as meetings, discussions etc. Based on the team’s velocity, appropriate number of stories is selected to be part of the Sprint. The team along with the security expert determines the number of security-focused stories to be included in the Sprint based on the business requirements. Each story will have a “How to Demo” field populated to assist the QA team in properly testing the various functionalities of the software component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/dev-team-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The development team is responsible for periodically checking in/syncing/rebasing their code into the enterprise version control system. The developer as well as the code reviewer must look for the successful completion of static code analysis. The development team is also responsible for setting up and configuring the various life cycle management servers such as the version control system, continuous integration server, dependency management, agile requirements management server etc. From time to time, the development team will also be responsible for peer code reviews, refactoring of code to improve performance and other non-functional architectural requirements. An automated code crawler that reviews the code for vulnerabilities such as OWASP Code Crawler is highly recommended over manual code reviews. Using the “defense in depth” principles, more than one type of code reviews can be done. The first pass could be the automatic code inspection through code crawlers as stated above and the second pass could be a manual code review by a peer or a security expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;qa-team-tasks&quot;&gt;2)  QA Team Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/qa-team-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The QA team is responsible for performing the acceptance testing and reporting of the results to the development team. The acceptance testing will include both functionality and security-focused testing according to SAFECode stories. The acceptance testing is typically carried out in the Test Server as shown in the above diagram. The QA team is also responsible for configuring and writing test plans for the automated test server such as Selenium. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/qa-team-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The QA team is also responsible for performing tests against the QA and production environments on the public cloud as shown in the above diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-team-tasks&quot;&gt;3)  Security Team Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/security-team-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;One of the major tasks of the security team is to train the scrum team on security practices that will successfully implement the stipulated security controls. The security team is also responsible for installing and configuring the necessary static code analysis tools, malware scanners, and code vulnerability scanners that can be automatically run upon on a build. The Continuous Integration Server will not deploy if the successful build failed one of the security tests such as static code analysis etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/security-team-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The security team is also responsible for securing the code deployment to the public cloud in terms of network equipment such as Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems etc. There is a need to set up firewall rules in terms of connectivity guidelines from the PaaS service provider such as protocol (HTTPS), ports, time of day restrictions etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/security-team-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The security team has to work with the PaaS broker or provider to set up the necessary SLA and incorporate provisions for security controls as described in the risk management framework section. It is this team’s responsibility to ensure that the “continuous monitoring” strategy is established and followed upon at a time interval stipulated in the SLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;automated-tasks&quot;&gt;4)  Automated Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Establishing a Continuous Integration (CI) Server is well worth the time and money. It makes a lot of sense for the development team to carve some time out to establish a version control system such as Atlassian Stash along with a CI Server (if there are none) with deployment plans such as Test, QA, and Production with appropriate build plans. As can be seen in Figure 16, the CI Server, according to the build/deployment plans setup, checks out the necessary source code from the version control system and executes those plans. Based on the deployment plan, it deploys the software component on Test, QA, or Production server as prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The integration server, such as Atlassian Bamboo, deploys the software component on the Test server. It then notifies the QA team to start the acceptance testing for the software component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The CI Server deploys the software component to the automated test server such as Selenium. The automated tests will also include security-focus tests such as code vulnerability testing, static code analysis, and running of malware scanners. These tools upon successfully completing their tests would notify the QA, security, and development teams with results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The CI Server deploys the software component in the PaaS environment on the public cloud. The deployment could be targeted for either the QA or the production environment. The server notifies the QA team to initiate testing on the QA or production stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the usage of the PaaS model in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iv-using-the-paas-service-model&quot;&gt;IV. USING THE PAAS SERVICE MODEL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in &lt;em&gt;Who Manages What?&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the cloud consumer is responsible for the application and data that are deployed on the platform provided by the cloud agent – namely, the broker or the provider. Therefore, the cloud consumer is responsible for implementing the security controls to secure the application and data. A large number of attacks originate in the application layer especially for web applications. The CSA organizes application security into the following areas of focus [4]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.  Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)&lt;br /&gt;
B.  Authentication, Authorization, Compliance&lt;br /&gt;
C.  Entitlement Processing and Encryption&lt;br /&gt;
D.  Application Penetration Testing for the Cloud&lt;br /&gt;
E.  Monitoring applications in the Cloud&lt;br /&gt;
F.  Application Authentication, Compliance and the repercussions of multi-tenancy and shared infrastructure&lt;br /&gt;
G.  Avoiding malicious software&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section will delve into two major topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secure application development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Penetration Tests for the cloud environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a--secure-software-development-life-cycle-ssdlc&quot;&gt;A.  Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good application security starts early in the software development life cycle. To have a sense of application security throughout the development cycle, it makes a lot of sense to adopt one of the maturity models in the SDLC such as Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM), Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), and System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this paper, we will explore the idea of incorporating security into agile development environments especially in Scrum-based web application software development [22]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;agile-scrum--a-quick-introduction&quot;&gt;1)  Agile Scrum – a quick introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths of this process framework is its ability to provide an “early feedback system” thereby an organization building the software can correct its course without spending too much time and money. Since the team developing the software constructs only a portion of the software at a time (a few features at a time), tests them, and deploys them. By deploying in chunks, the organization is able to get a set of early feedback from the marketplace and is able to correct its course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/scrum-process-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scrum Process Flow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section introduces the various elements of the Scrum process from a 1000-foot view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Scrum Team
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scrum Master
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Person responsible for the Scrum process, its correct implementation, and the maximization of its benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Not a leader of the team because the team is expected to be self-organizing.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Responsible for removing any impediments between the development team, product owner, and customers.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Product Owner (PO)
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;A person responsible for managing the product backlog in terms of priority&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Development Team
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Scrum team consists of 2-7 developers.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The team makes decisions during the development in conjunction with the product owner.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;When there is a need for a bigger team (&amp;gt;7), split them to form multiple teams based on themes or epics.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Artifacts
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;User Story
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;A simple descriptive line of the requirement or feature that the PO is after. E.g. “Charge customer’s credit/debit card for the services rendered”.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Epic
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;A set of user stories. For example, an epic could be about “Online Payment processing”.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Product Backlog
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Backlog is a prioritized list of project requirements or user stories or Epics with rough estimates. Estimates are based on story points.
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;An example of a story point could equate to an ideal man-day where the day is devoid of any external influences so that the developer could concentrate on the task 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The list is sorted based on estimates in descending order.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sprint Backlog
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;A set of project requirements taken from the product backlog to be worked on during a specific Sprint. &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scrum Events
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sprint
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Sprint is a period of time, a time box, that the team is expected to work on the Sprint backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Typically, 2-4 week sprints are common.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Daily Scrum Meetings
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Fifteen minute standup meeting to discuss the following items:
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Accomplishments from the last meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;What is slated to be done before the next meeting&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Any impediments to be removed for project progress.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sprint Planning Meetings
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;PO presents the high priority items to the team&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The team decides as to what can or cannot be done during a particular sprint with an action plan document.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Typically, the team attempts to split the user story into multiple tasks at this meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Security-focused stories and tasks are discussed and included.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Sprint Review meeting or Demo
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;During this meeting, the team demonstrates all the completed features that are part of a sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Sprint Retrospective meeting
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;The team discusses “Lessons learned” during the Sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following the process flow, the development team in conjunction with the Scrum Master and the Product Owner is able to engage in constant communication (informal) to properly handle requirements elicitation/analysis and subsequently the product feature code development and deployment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missing-security-focus-in-agile-scrum&quot;&gt;2)  Missing Security Focus in Agile Scrum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not a fault of the process framework, the emphasis on quick turn-around of feature implementation doesn’t help either. Since the “Sprints” are typically time-boxed between 2 and 4 weeks, developers often ignore application security controls or put them on the back burner. Since the PO is more interested in shipping the product with a heavy focus on business functionality, there is no step to ensure security controls are put in place by enforcing that the security requirements are captured in the stories and security-focused tasks are performed during the construction and testing phases of each story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;securing-the-sdlc-in-agile-scrum&quot;&gt;3)  Securing the SDLC in Agile Scrum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in the previous section, the development team constructs a set of user stories at a time (sprint backlog within 2-4 week sprints). To have a constant security awareness, user story after user story and Sprint after Sprint, it makes a lot of sense to have a permanent security-focused member on the team as shown in the following diagram – adapted from [24]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/scrum-team-organization.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scrum Team Organization&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;* T – member with testing skills; S – member with Security skills&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with regular functionality testing, the QA team can also test for security issues and send the release back to the development team for fixes as shown in the diagram below – adapted from [24]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A portion of the Sprint is dedicated to implementing SAFECode stories
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This can be accomplished by adjusting the focus factor if the PO and the stakeholders don’t fully understand the security implications.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A portion of bug-fixes address security vulnerabilities found during QA testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/sprint-release-engineering-with-acceptance-testing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sprint Release Engineering with Acceptance Testing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of the team member will entail the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conduct security analysis of all product features in the Sprint backlog
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Conduct a threat model for each user story&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security aspects to be considered, including but not limited to policy/compliance, legal, contractual, regulatory, and other security-related requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notify the PO of the security requirements in the Sprint planning meeting
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Engage the Scrum master to work with legal and other departments to ensure security obligations are properly met.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Adjust the story points of the stories/epics accordingly&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User stories that have security implications would need to have additional tasks defined to cater to the implementation of security controls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure that the Sprint doesn’t collect “Security Debt” [22] as a team
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the application has to ship with some security debt, ensure that the relevant stakeholders understand the risks and sign off on them&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Undone security tasks must go on the product backlog, so they can be included in one of the future Sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;safecode-guidelines-for-the-scrum-team&quot;&gt;4)  SAFECode guidelines for the Scrum team&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAFECode has defined a set of 36 security-focused stories with a breakdown of technical tasks that go along with each story. These stories are meant for the development and QA teams. One of the stories from the SAFECode guidelines is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/safecode-security-focused-story.png&quot; alt=&quot;SAFECode Security-focused Story&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;safecode-guidelines-for-the-scrum-team-as-software-maintenance-tasks&quot;&gt;5)  SAFECode guidelines for the Scrum team as software maintenance tasks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to periodically run static code analysis tools, vulnerability scanners, and automated malware scanners during build/release cycles and fix the reported high-priority issues reported by those tools. Some of the guidelines provided by SAFECode are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/safecode-guidelines-for-software-maintenace.png&quot; alt=&quot;SAFECode Guidelines for Software Maintenance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to allocate time to do “code reviews” of riskier codes. SAFECode provides the definition of riskier code as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/safecode-categorization-of-riskier-code.png&quot; alt=&quot;SAFECode Guidelines for Security Experts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the previous sections, the Agile Scrum process could be made secure. The PO has to have visibility into these security tasks, as performing some of these security-focused tasks would impact the team’s velocity. In order for the SDLC to be secure and to ensure that the product that is put out Sprint after Sprint is secure, the team needs support from all the stakeholders especially from the line of business managers, IT functional managers, Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and in some cases the support of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing from where we left off in &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lets start exploring the risk management framework for  a little more in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii----risk-management-framework&quot;&gt;III.    RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the actors, outlined in &lt;strong&gt;Part 1 - Roles and Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;, have varying degrees of ownership and influence in the cloud space, establishing security controls becomes a shared or split responsibility among the actors. From the cloud consumer’s angle, security should not be an impediment to embracing public cloud solutions. With that idea in mind, the risk management framework provides a step-by-step approach to identifying and documenting risks in general and validating as to what are acceptable risks to a consumer in relation to the compliance model, so that the cloud consumer can place a level of confidence in moving all the acceptable web applications/systems to the public cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the NIST’s cloud-adapted risk management framework (CRMF)[13]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/cloud-adapted-risk-management-framework.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cloud-adapted Risk Management Framework&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;categorize-information-systems&quot;&gt;1)  Categorize Information Systems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step enables organizations to consistently map the security impact levels to the types of information and information systems. The type of information includes private, confidential, sensitive etc. The type of information systems includes mission critical, mission support etc. An information system processes one or more information types as input, output, and/or for internal needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security objectives and the potential losses for information and information systems could be broadly classified in terms of the classical security goals as follows [19]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a--confidentiality&quot;&gt;a)  Confidentiality&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b--integrity&quot;&gt;b)  Integrity&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;c--availability&quot;&gt;c)  Availability&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or information systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Potential impact to an organization in case of a security breach could be modeled in terms of low, medium, and high ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a--low-impact&quot;&gt;a)  Low Impact&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this impact level, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would not impact the primary business objectives of the organization. There will be some degradation in mission capability and minor damage to organizational assets, but this would not stop the organization from meeting its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b--medium-impact&quot;&gt;b)  Medium Impact&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this impact level, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would impact the primary business objectives of the organization. There will be significant degradation in mission capability and significant damage to organizational assets and/or operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;c--high-impact&quot;&gt;c)  High Impact&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this impact level, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would severely impact the primary business objectives of the organization. There will be major degradation or loss of mission capability and major damage or loss of organizational assets and/or operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One way to identify information types could be based on the lines of businesses of an organization. For example, lines of businesses could include marketing, sales, manufacturing, R&amp;amp;D, learning &amp;amp; performance, dealer management etc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since every organization has a set of resource management areas such as information technology &amp;amp; management, human resources management, and financial management, care must be taken to include such resource management functions and their information types as well. For example, some of the information types within the human resources management function could be HR strategy, staff acquisition, employee performance mgmt., employee relation, benefits mgmt., and compensation mgmt., etc.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the information types and information systems are identified, the next step is to assign potential impact of compromises to confidentiality, integrity, and availability as outlined in the following table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/categorization-table.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table 1: Categorization&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the information type of an organization’s corporate website for public consumption does not have any confidentiality requirement because everything on the website is for public consumption. Therefore, the security category could be defined in terms of the C/I/A triad as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;

Security Category_{public information} = \\
        \{(confidentiality, not applicable), 
            (integrity, medium), \\
            (availability, medium)\} 
          
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After assigning security categories to all the information types that belong to a business area or a resource management function, all the information systems that support those functions must be mapped to those information types. This is a required step to aggregate the security category at the information system level. For example, a web-based contract renewal system could process two information types as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;
Security Category_{contract information}= \\
\{(confidentiality,medium),(integrity,medium),(availability,low)\}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;
Security Category_{administrative information}= \\
    \{(confidentiality,low),(integrity,low),(availability,low)\}

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting aggregate security category for the information system will be the maximum of the above two categories in each of the C/I/A triad as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;
Security Category_{web contracts system}= \\
\{(confidentiality,medium),(integrity,medium),(availability,low)\}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When aggregating security categories, it is also beneficial to understand the context of the information system in relation to other systems – standalone, connected process flow etc. Without understanding the overall context, assignment of security categories could be erroneous.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of step 1, categorization of information systems, the organization must have a spreadsheet with all the information systems that are being evaluated for the suitability of moving over to the public cloud. This spreadsheet will contain all web-based information systems and their aggregate security categories mapped to their business area or resource management functional area.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;identify-security-requirements&quot;&gt;2)  Identify Security Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIST defines seventeen security-related areas with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and the information processed, stored, and/or transmitted by those systems [20]. Those security-related areas are access control, audit and availability, certification, configuration management, contingency planning, identification and authentication, incident response, maintenance, media protection, physical and environment protection, planning, personnel security, risk assessment, systems and services acquisition, system and communications protection, system and information integrity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of PaaS and SaaS, the majority of the selection of the security controls falls under the cloud agents such as the cloud provider, cloud broker, and cloud carrier. These cloud actors are required to address the cloud consumer’s areas of concerns as proposed by the NIST’s Security Reference Architecture [13] as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Risk Management
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Risk analysis&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Risk Assessments&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability assessment&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Incident reporting and response&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business Continuity
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Disaster recovery plans&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recovery plans&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recovery Point Objective (RPO)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recovery Time Objective (RTO)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical Security
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Physical and environmental security policy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Contingency plan&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Emergency response plan&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Facility layout&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Security Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Human Resources&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Visual inspection of the facility&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User account termination procedures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compliance with National and International/Industry standards on security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transparent view of the security posture of the cloud provider, cloud broker, and the cloud carriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that an organization does not have to spend the time and money to create the combination of security components and how they map to responsibilities of various cloud actors from scratch. The CSA provides a comprehensive cloud control matrix based on the Trusted Cloud Initiative Reference Architecture (TCI-RA) as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/csa-cloud-control-matrix-1-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table 2: The CSA Cloud Control Matrix v1.4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This excel sheet can be downloaded from [14]. What is good about this excel sheet is that it spells out the responsibility for establishing security controls among the various cloud actors. The NIST Security Reference Architecture (SRA) has adopted the TCI-RA and has created 346 security components under three different domains such as Business Operation Support Service (BOSS), Information Technology Operation Support (ITOS), and Security and Risk Management (S&amp;amp;RM) and four different service layers such as infrastructure services, information services, application services, and presentation services. Therefore, this is a streamlined, transparent risk management process where the responsibilities are clearly delineated as shown in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/nist-sra-actor-based-responsibility-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table 3: The NIST SRA Actor-based Responsibility Chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above chart, “X” indicates that the respective security component has to be implemented by the actor; “A” indicates that the security component has to be implemented internally; “B” indicates that this is for “business broker only” and there is no direct association with the consumer; blank cell indicates that the security component is not needed for securing the cloud platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a mapping of security components from the TCI-RA to the NIST 800-53 family of security controls in the “800-53 Family” column in the spreadsheet. In the above example, &lt;strong&gt;BOSS→ Compliance→Intellectual Property Protection&lt;/strong&gt; is mapped to &lt;strong&gt;Access Control (AC)&lt;/strong&gt;. Similarly, there is a mapping to Awareness and Training (AT) as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Using the above methods, we now have a way to map security components to cloud deployment models with an eye towards which actor is responsible for what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now becomes as to what security components are absolutely needed by the consumer to have a secure move to the public cloud. This is where the combination of the last step – categorize information systems – and the security index system (SIS) comes in.  SIS defines five index values from zero to four as follows [13]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/sis.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table 4: The Security Index System (SIS)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on security category obtained from applying step one, the cloud consumer could go on to applying security index values to all the security components as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/nist-sis-draft.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table 5: NIST SIS (Draft)&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;* Ag = Aggregate score&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these steps, all the cloud actors know exactly what security components are needed for the migration and who is responsible for implementing them. This will also give an idea about choosing the right service model (PaaS or SaaS) for the web application in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSA has a specific gap analysis model where the cloud actors could go about selecting the right set of security components for their cloud platform based on their compliance needs such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if an organization accepts, captures, stores, transmits, or processes credit/debit card data through one of its e-commerce application, the organization is expected to follow PCI DSS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the organization wants to migrate its application to the public cloud, all the relevant cloud agents – cloud consumer, provider, broker, carrier, and/or auditor – are expected to have all the necessary security components along with the controls in place to support the PCI DSS standard. To conform to PCI DSS standards, the cloud actors have to ensure that the following security components are implemented as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/csa-recommendation-for-pci-dss-on-public-cloud.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table 5: NIST SIS (Draft)&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;* Merchant = Cloud Consumer; PAN = Personal Access Number&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the same token, similar security requirements can be gathered for HIPAA, GLBA, and SOX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of step two, all the relevant cloud actors must know the baseline security controls and any supplemental controls needed due to compliance needs of the cloud consumer. The selection of controls could be based on the in-house technical expertise of the cloud consumer along with its assurance needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;select-the-cloud-ecosystem-architecture&quot;&gt;3)  Select the Cloud Ecosystem Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the business requirements and the security requirements outlined in the previous section, a cloud consumer could make a decision to either go with a single cloud provider or a set of cloud providers with the help of a broker as shown in the diagram below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/broker-based-cloud-ecosystem-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Broker-based Cloud Ecosystem Architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario where a consumer is in need of a web content management solution, a video encoding service so the consumer could post videos across a wide variety of social websites such as Facebook, Twitter etc. and a Web development platform based on the “Spring” framework. In order to avail all of the above services, the cloud consumer might need to seek the help of three different cloud providers as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Provider A&lt;/em&gt; – A SaaS-based Web Content Management Solution. E.g. SpringCM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Provider B&lt;/em&gt; – A SaaS-based Video Encoding services. E.g. Brightcove&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud Provider C&lt;/em&gt; – A PaaS-based Web development platform based on the Spring Framework. E.g. CloudFoundry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand and implement all the security controls required to support the assurance needs, the cloud consumer has to deal with multiple Service Level Agreements (SLA) across the various cloud providers. Depending upon the technical expertise and the number of personnel supporting such efforts, the task of managing multiple SLAs could be daunting. This is where cloud brokers come in. As shown in the above figure, the cloud consumer is only signing one SLA with the broker leaving the entire responsibility of managing the business and security requirements across all of the cloud providers with the broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assess-the-cloud-services&quot;&gt;4)  Assess the Cloud Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the set of security controls selected in step two and the ecosystem architecture selected in step three, the cloud consumer is well on the way to defining the service level agreement (SLA) with the intended cloud agent(s) – broker or provider(s). The SLA details the levels and types of services that are to be provided, including but not limited to the delivery time and performance parameters. A mind map of an SLA is shown below [13]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/mindmap-of-SLA.png&quot; alt=&quot;The mind map of SLA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the responsibility of the cloud consumer to ensure that default contracts are not accepted when setting up the master service agreements. From a provider’s perspective it may be easy, but the agreement might not capture all of the assurance needs of the consumer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;authorize-cloud-services&quot;&gt;5)  Authorize Cloud Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, the cloud consumer must define a set of metrics that can validate the expectations defined in the service contract as stated in the previous step. The NIST Cloud Service Metrics document [21] defines a set of metrics for cloud services. An example is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Service Availability – Percentage of uptime of resource over a period of time where:
&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;
Service\_Uptime\_Percentage = \frac{Qualified\_Uptime\_Total}{Observation\_Time\_Total} \times 100
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For example, the SLA could state that the objective of the service availability metric to be: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt; Service\_Uptime\_Percentage=99\% &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar set of metrics must be defined in advance to ensure a proper delivery of services by the cloud brokers/providers. For example, “the number of concurrent users and the response time of the platform/service” could be one of the metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;monitor-the-services-provided&quot;&gt;6)  Monitor the services provided&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the crucial step to ensuring that the security controls that have been put in place as a part of securing the cloud service are functioning as intended and maintain the necessary security posture. Continuous monitoring enables the cloud agents to supplement security controls in case there is a need. A strategy for continuous monitoring could define as to how security and privacy controls will be monitored over time as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frequency of monitoring activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rigor and extent of monitoring activities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data feeds to be provided to the consumer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuous monitoring strategy allows the consumer to see whether the SLA terms are met on an ongoing basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these six steps must be able to prepare an organization to successfully move to the public cloud for their Web application needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does “going to the public cloud” mean to organizations?  Other than the benefits such as reduced time to market, less upfront cost, rapid elasticity in terms of hardware and software resources, there are several security implications associated with such a move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s corporations not only create and manage web applications to make their corporate presence known on the Internet, but also invite their employees, suppliers, and dealers/retailers to conduct business online. At this point, the question becomes “Where should an organization stop or draw the line when making decisions to go to the pubic cloud?” Because the case for public-facing web applications going to the public cloud has already been made. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the viability of engaging public clouds for all web applications irrespective of the user segment that they support. This paper will also outline a development process and an environment for successfully deploying secure web applications on the public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iintroduction&quot;&gt;I.	INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (For example, networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [1].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/nist-definition-of-the-cloud.png&quot; alt=&quot;NIST Definition of the Cloud&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)&lt;/em&gt; – In this cloud service model, the provider offers raw computing power, storage, and network infrastructure so that the consumer can load his/her own software components such as operating systems, applications, etc. in this infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platform as a Service (PaaS)&lt;/em&gt; - PaaS builds on IaaS and adds a set of software components such as operating systems, middleware products (application servers), and Web servers so that the consumer can develop and deploy applications in this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS)&lt;/em&gt; - SaaS builds on top of PaaS and adds fully developed applications such as billing, collaboration, digital asset management, web content management, customer relationship management, point of sale applications to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;To keep the scope manageable, this paper will only discuss SaaS and PaaS service models that are deployed using the public deployment model as highlighted in Figure 1. In the SaaS service model, an organization does not manage or control either the underlying infrastructure or the application that is deployed in the infrastructure. In the PaaS service model, the organization does not control or manage the underlying infrastructure, but does have control over the applications and data that are deployed in the infrastructure [2] as shown below:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/who-manages-what.png&quot; alt=&quot;Who Manages What?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Cloud means that both the underlying platform (PaaS) and the applications (SaaS) that are hosted on the infrastructure are available to the general public and is owned and/or operated by an organization selling those cloud services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aroles-and-responsibilities-in-the-cloud&quot;&gt;A.	Roles and responsibilities in the Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;In order to study the security implications of using the public cloud for the intended service models, we have to understand the roles and responsibilities of the major actors in the cloud-computing domain [3] as shown below:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/roles-and-responsibilities.png&quot; alt=&quot;Roles and Responsibilities&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-consumer&quot;&gt;1)	Cloud Consumer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cloud consumer is an organization that makes use of the services provided by the cloud providers and brokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-provider&quot;&gt;2)	Cloud Provider&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cloud provider is an organization or entity that offers one or more cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) via one or more deployment models (public, private, hybrid) to interested parties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-broker&quot;&gt;3)	Cloud Broker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;As the application needs increase, the service models could get extremely complex. At this juncture, the cloud consumer could seek the help of a broker instead of going directly to the cloud provider. The cloud broker’s prime responsibility is to aggregate, enhance, or augment the services provided by one or more cloud service providers as shown in the diagram [3] below:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/cloud-broker-model.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cloud Broker Model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above scenario, the cloud consumer does not need to know about the underlying cloud providers since the service level agreement (SLA) will be created between the consumer and the broker. The cloud broker in turn will have SLAs with the cloud providers to satisfy the service levels that were committed to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-auditor&quot;&gt;4)	Cloud Auditor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other important actor from the reference model is the cloud auditor. A cloud consumer, broker, or provider could employ an auditor to verify the security controls, privacy impact, and performance of services provided by the cloud provider.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-carrier&quot;&gt;5)	Cloud Carrier&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;A cloud carrier is an intermediary that provides connectivity and transport of cloud services from the cloud provider to the consumer.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/cloud-carrier-model.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cloud Carrier Model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above scenario [3], a cloud provider could seek the help of a cloud carrier to provide dedicated and/or encrypted connections between the provider’s services and the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iisecurity-implications&quot;&gt;II.	SECURITY IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 1, more control or management of components means responsibility for security controls. In the PaaS environment, since the cloud consumer is responsible for building and deploying applications, layering in an additional level of security controls at the application level falls under the cloud consumer. By the same token, the cloud provider is responsible for establishing security controls for all the other components including the middleware environment. Since there is very little extensibility option available for the consumer in the SaaS model, the provider bares responsibility for establishing security controls for the entire environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amulti-tenancy&quot;&gt;A.	Multi-tenancy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;One of the major characteristics of cloud computing is this idea of multi-tenancy. Multi-tenancy implies the use of same applications and resources by multiple cloud consumers that may belong to multiple organizations. Multi-tenancy allows cloud providers to provide economies of scale, availability, segmentation, isolation, and operational efficiency to their consumers [4].  Since PaaS builds on the infrastructure provided by IaaS and SaaS builds on PaaS, there is quite a bit of technology components that work together to enable multi-tenancy as shown in the following diagram:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/multi-tenancy-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-tenancy Model 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;In the case of IaaS, the same hardware resources are shared across multiple consumers using virtualization technologies as shown in the diagram below:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/multi-tenancy-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-tenancy Model 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;avirtual-machine-manager-vmm-also-known-as-hypervisor&quot;&gt;a)	Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) also known as Hypervisor&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMM is the virtualization layer that runs on top of a server platform and manages CPU, memory, hard disk, network, and other hardware resources of the server host [5]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;bvm&quot;&gt;b)	VM&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software implementation of a physical computing environment in which the operating system and other application programs can be installed and run [5]. VMs emulates a physical computing environment and requests hardware resources such as CPU, memory etc. from the VMM. Some of the most common virtualization solutions in the market today include Xen, VMware, Hyper-V, and Oracle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of PaaS, middleware and other components could be installed and run within the VM. In the case of SaaS, a wide variety of applications can be installed and run on top of the middleware that is running within the VM. Therefore, the cloud consumer of PaaS or SaaS ends up in a virtual machine as shown in Figure 5. Using the virtualization technology, cloud providers could virtualize the hardware/platform, desktop, software, memory, storage, data, and network to successfully orchestrate services such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-breaches-and-shared-technology-threats&quot;&gt;2)	Data Breaches and Shared technology threats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the security challenges of the virtualization technology is how isolated these individual virtual machines are from each other. In other words, ensuring sufficient isolation between VMs is the security challenge. As shown in Figure 5, a security compromise in the virtualization layer means that all the VMs running on the virtualized layer are also compromised thereby resulting in data breaches. The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has elevated this threat ranking from 5 to 1 in 2013 [6]. There are several articles on the Internet such as [7] that demonstrate as to how a malicious VM could extract fine-grained information from a victim’s VM running on the same physical computer. There are also vulnerabilities present in the virtualization technology that could compromise the entire fleet of VMs running on the VMMs [8]. One of the articles, [9], demonstrates the use of VASTO (Virtualization Assessment Tool) within the Metasploit framework (MSF) to compromise VMware hosts with dictionary-based brute force login, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack etc. VASTO in conjunction with MSF could be used to compromise hosts that are running Xen, Hyper-V, and Oracle VMMs as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;acontrols&quot;&gt;a)	Controls&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of the cloud provider, a third-party cloud auditor could be employed to assess as to how secure or vulnerable the target virtual environment is. There are several tools such as VASTO, Netwrix, Blackbird Auditor, and VMinformer that could be successfully employed to audit the virtual environment in terms of client, hypervisor, support, management, and internal components. These tools check for the presence of misconfiguration, missing security patches, bad network scheme, weaknesses in the VMM layer, and Storage misconfiguration [9].  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-threats&quot;&gt;3)	More Threats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with data breaches and shared technology threats as outlined in the previous section, there are several other threats such as data loss, account or service traffic hijacking, insecure interfaces and APIs by the cloud provider, denial of service, malicious insiders, and insufficient due diligence [6].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;acontrols-1&quot;&gt;a)	Controls&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat the various threats – see previous paragraph, establishment of a proper organization-wide risk management framework is essential. This is also part of doing due diligence that a cloud consumer is expected to carry out before embarking on the journey to move to the public cloud. Along with a solid risk management framework, there is also a greater need for securing web applications against a wide variety of attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), thread safety, access control, hidden form field manipulation, parameter manipulation, weak session cookies, SQL injection, insecure Web services, and Fail open authentication attacks [10]. Next set of sections will discuss the risk management framework along with a model for engineering secure web applications by taking the Open Security Architecture’s cloud computing security pattern, NIST’s cloud computing documents, CSA’s security reference model, OWASP’s web application security guidelines, SAFECode guidelines for Agile process frameworks into account. &lt;/p&gt;
