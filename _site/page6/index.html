    <p>Continuing from where we left off in <a href="http://naruraghavan.github.io/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-2"><strong>Part 2</strong></a>, lets start exploring the usage of the PaaS model in this post.</p>

<h2 id="iv-using-the-paas-service-model">IV. USING THE PAAS SERVICE MODEL</h2>
<p>As illustrated in <em>Who Manages What?</em> in <a href="http://naruraghavan.github.io/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-2"><strong>Part 2</strong></a>, the cloud consumer is responsible for the application and data that are deployed on the platform provided by the cloud agent – namely, the broker or the provider. Therefore, the cloud consumer is responsible for implementing the security controls to secure the application and data. A large number of attacks originate in the application layer especially for web applications. The CSA organizes application security into the following areas of focus [4]:</p>

<p>A.  Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)<br />
B.  Authentication, Authorization, Compliance<br />
C.  Entitlement Processing and Encryption<br />
D.  Application Penetration Testing for the Cloud<br />
E.  Monitoring applications in the Cloud<br />
F.  Application Authentication, Compliance and the repercussions of multi-tenancy and shared infrastructure<br />
G.  Avoiding malicious software</p>

<p>The following section will delve into two major topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Secure application development</li>
  <li>Penetration Tests for the cloud environment</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a--secure-software-development-life-cycle-ssdlc">A.  Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)</h3>
<p>A good application security starts early in the software development life cycle. To have a sense of application security throughout the development cycle, it makes a lot of sense to adopt one of the maturity models in the SDLC such as Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM), Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), and System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM). </p>

<p>For the purposes of this paper, we will explore the idea of incorporating security into agile development environments especially in Scrum-based web application software development [22]. </p>

<h4 id="agile-scrum--a-quick-introduction">1)  Agile Scrum – a quick introduction</h4>

<p>One of the strengths of this process framework is its ability to provide an “early feedback system” thereby an organization building the software can correct its course without spending too much time and money. Since the team developing the software constructs only a portion of the software at a time (a few features at a time), tests them, and deploys them. By deploying in chunks, the organization is able to get a set of early feedback from the marketplace and is able to correct its course.</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/scrum-process-flow.png" alt="Scrum Process Flow" /></p>

<p>The following section introduces the various elements of the Scrum process from a 1000-foot view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Scrum Team
    <ul>
      <li>Scrum Master
        <ul>
          <li>Person responsible for the Scrum process, its correct implementation, and the maximization of its benefits.</li>
          <li>Not a leader of the team because the team is expected to be self-organizing.</li>
          <li>Responsible for removing any impediments between the development team, product owner, and customers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Product Owner (PO)
        <ul>
          <li>A person responsible for managing the product backlog in terms of priority</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Development Team
        <ul>
          <li>Scrum team consists of 2-7 developers.</li>
          <li>The team makes decisions during the development in conjunction with the product owner.</li>
          <li>When there is a need for a bigger team (&gt;7), split them to form multiple teams based on themes or epics.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Artifacts
    <ul>
      <li>User Story
        <ul>
          <li>A simple descriptive line of the requirement or feature that the PO is after. E.g. “Charge customer’s credit/debit card for the services rendered”.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Epic
        <ul>
          <li>A set of user stories. For example, an epic could be about “Online Payment processing”.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Product Backlog
        <ul>
          <li>Backlog is a prioritized list of project requirements or user stories or Epics with rough estimates. Estimates are based on story points.
            <ul>
              <li>An example of a story point could equate to an ideal man-day where the day is devoid of any external influences so that the developer could concentrate on the task 100%.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The list is sorted based on estimates in descending order.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sprint Backlog
        <ul>
          <li>A set of project requirements taken from the product backlog to be worked on during a specific Sprint. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scrum Events
    <ul>
      <li>Sprint
        <ul>
          <li>Sprint is a period of time, a time box, that the team is expected to work on the Sprint backlog.</li>
          <li>Typically, 2-4 week sprints are common.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Daily Scrum Meetings
        <ul>
          <li>Fifteen minute standup meeting to discuss the following items:
            <ul>
              <li>Accomplishments from the last meeting.</li>
              <li>What is slated to be done before the next meeting</li>
              <li>Any impediments to be removed for project progress.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Sprint Planning Meetings
        <ul>
          <li>PO presents the high priority items to the team</li>
          <li>The team decides as to what can or cannot be done during a particular sprint with an action plan document.</li>
          <li>Typically, the team attempts to split the user story into multiple tasks at this meeting.</li>
          <li>Security-focused stories and tasks are discussed and included.</li>
          <li>Sprint Review meeting or Demo
            <ul>
              <li>During this meeting, the team demonstrates all the completed features that are part of a sprint.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sprint Retrospective meeting
            <ul>
              <li>The team discusses “Lessons learned” during the Sprint.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By following the process flow, the development team in conjunction with the Scrum Master and the Product Owner is able to engage in constant communication (informal) to properly handle requirements elicitation/analysis and subsequently the product feature code development and deployment. </p>

<h4 id="missing-security-focus-in-agile-scrum">2)  Missing Security Focus in Agile Scrum</h4>

<p>Though not a fault of the process framework, the emphasis on quick turn-around of feature implementation doesn’t help either. Since the “Sprints” are typically time-boxed between 2 and 4 weeks, developers often ignore application security controls or put them on the back burner. Since the PO is more interested in shipping the product with a heavy focus on business functionality, there is no step to ensure security controls are put in place by enforcing that the security requirements are captured in the stories and security-focused tasks are performed during the construction and testing phases of each story.</p>

<h4 id="securing-the-sdlc-in-agile-scrum">3)  Securing the SDLC in Agile Scrum</h4>

<p>As explained in the previous section, the development team constructs a set of user stories at a time (sprint backlog within 2-4 week sprints). To have a constant security awareness, user story after user story and Sprint after Sprint, it makes a lot of sense to have a permanent security-focused member on the team as shown in the following diagram – adapted from [24]:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/scrum-team-organization.png" alt="Scrum Team Organization" /><br />
<sub>* T – member with testing skills; S – member with Security skills</sub></p>

<p>Along with regular functionality testing, the QA team can also test for security issues and send the release back to the development team for fixes as shown in the diagram below – adapted from [24]:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A portion of the Sprint is dedicated to implementing SAFECode stories
    <ul>
      <li>This can be accomplished by adjusting the focus factor if the PO and the stakeholders don’t fully understand the security implications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A portion of bug-fixes address security vulnerabilities found during QA testing</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/sprint-release-engineering-with-acceptance-testing.png" alt="Sprint Release Engineering with Acceptance Testing" /></p>

<p>The responsibility of the team member will entail the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct security analysis of all product features in the Sprint backlog
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct a threat model for each user story</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security aspects to be considered, including but not limited to policy/compliance, legal, contractual, regulatory, and other security-related requirements</li>
  <li>Notify the PO of the security requirements in the Sprint planning meeting
    <ul>
      <li>Engage the Scrum master to work with legal and other departments to ensure security obligations are properly met.</li>
      <li>Adjust the story points of the stories/epics accordingly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>User stories that have security implications would need to have additional tasks defined to cater to the implementation of security controls.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the Sprint doesn’t collect “Security Debt” [22] as a team
    <ul>
      <li>If the application has to ship with some security debt, ensure that the relevant stakeholders understand the risks and sign off on them</li>
      <li>Undone security tasks must go on the product backlog, so they can be included in one of the future Sprints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="safecode-guidelines-for-the-scrum-team">4)  SAFECode guidelines for the Scrum team</h4>

<p>SAFECode has defined a set of 36 security-focused stories with a breakdown of technical tasks that go along with each story. These stories are meant for the development and QA teams. One of the stories from the SAFECode guidelines is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/safecode-security-focused-story.png" alt="SAFECode Security-focused Story" /></p>

<h4 id="safecode-guidelines-for-the-scrum-team-as-software-maintenance-tasks">5)  SAFECode guidelines for the Scrum team as software maintenance tasks</h4>

<p>The idea here is to periodically run static code analysis tools, vulnerability scanners, and automated malware scanners during build/release cycles and fix the reported high-priority issues reported by those tools. Some of the guidelines provided by SAFECode are shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/safecode-guidelines-for-software-maintenace.png" alt="SAFECode Guidelines for Software Maintenance" /></p>

<p>It is also important to allocate time to do “code reviews” of riskier codes. SAFECode provides the definition of riskier code as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/safecode-categorization-of-riskier-code.png" alt="SAFECode Guidelines for Security Experts" /></p>

<p>As shown in the previous sections, the Agile Scrum process could be made secure. The PO has to have visibility into these security tasks, as performing some of these security-focused tasks would impact the team’s velocity. In order for the SDLC to be secure and to ensure that the product that is put out Sprint after Sprint is secure, the team needs support from all the stakeholders especially from the line of business managers, IT functional managers, Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and in some cases the support of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). </p>

<h2 id="iii----risk-management-framework">III.    RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK</h2>
<p>Since the actors, outlined in <strong>Part 1 - Roles and Responsibilities</strong>, have varying degrees of ownership and influence in the cloud space, establishing security controls becomes a shared or split responsibility among the actors. From the cloud consumer’s angle, security should not be an impediment to embracing public cloud solutions. With that idea in mind, the risk management framework provides a step-by-step approach to identifying and documenting risks in general and validating as to what are acceptable risks to a consumer in relation to the compliance model, so that the cloud consumer can place a level of confidence in moving all the acceptable web applications/systems to the public cloud. </p>

<p>The following diagram shows the NIST’s cloud-adapted risk management framework (CRMF)[13]:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/cloud-adapted-risk-management-framework.png" alt="Cloud-adapted Risk Management Framework" /></p>

<h4 id="categorize-information-systems">1)  Categorize Information Systems</h4>
<p>This step enables organizations to consistently map the security impact levels to the types of information and information systems. The type of information includes private, confidential, sensitive etc. The type of information systems includes mission critical, mission support etc. An information system processes one or more information types as input, output, and/or for internal needs.</p>

<p>The security objectives and the potential losses for information and information systems could be broadly classified in terms of the classical security goals as follows [19]:</p>

<h5 id="a--confidentiality">a)  Confidentiality</h5>
<p>A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.</p>

<h5 id="b--integrity">b)  Integrity</h5>
<p>A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.</p>

<h5 id="c--availability">c)  Availability</h5>
<p>A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or information systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Potential impact to an organization in case of a security breach could be modeled in terms of low, medium, and high ratings. </p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a--low-impact">a)  Low Impact</h5>
<p>At this impact level, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would not impact the primary business objectives of the organization. There will be some degradation in mission capability and minor damage to organizational assets, but this would not stop the organization from meeting its objectives.</p>

<h5 id="b--medium-impact">b)  Medium Impact</h5>
<p>At this impact level, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would impact the primary business objectives of the organization. There will be significant degradation in mission capability and significant damage to organizational assets and/or operations.</p>

<h5 id="c--high-impact">c)  High Impact</h5>
<p>At this impact level, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would severely impact the primary business objectives of the organization. There will be major degradation or loss of mission capability and major damage or loss of organizational assets and/or operations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One way to identify information types could be based on the lines of businesses of an organization. For example, lines of businesses could include marketing, sales, manufacturing, R&amp;D, learning &amp; performance, dealer management etc.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since every organization has a set of resource management areas such as information technology &amp; management, human resources management, and financial management, care must be taken to include such resource management functions and their information types as well. For example, some of the information types within the human resources management function could be HR strategy, staff acquisition, employee performance mgmt., employee relation, benefits mgmt., and compensation mgmt., etc.   </p>

<p>Once the information types and information systems are identified, the next step is to assign potential impact of compromises to confidentiality, integrity, and availability as outlined in the following table:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/categorization-table.png" alt="Table 1: Categorization" /></p>

<p>For example, the information type of an organization’s corporate website for public consumption does not have any confidentiality requirement because everything on the website is for public consumption. Therefore, the security category could be defined in terms of the C/I/A triad as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">

Security Category_{public information} = \\
        \{(confidentiality, not applicable), 
            (integrity, medium), \\
            (availability, medium)\} 
          
</script>

<p>After assigning security categories to all the information types that belong to a business area or a resource management function, all the information systems that support those functions must be mapped to those information types. This is a required step to aggregate the security category at the information system level. For example, a web-based contract renewal system could process two information types as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
Security Category_{contract information}= \\
\{(confidentiality,medium),(integrity,medium),(availability,low)\}
</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
Security Category_{administrative information}= \\
    \{(confidentiality,low),(integrity,low),(availability,low)\}

</script>

<p>The resulting aggregate security category for the information system will be the maximum of the above two categories in each of the C/I/A triad as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
Security Category_{web contracts system}= \\
\{(confidentiality,medium),(integrity,medium),(availability,low)\}
</script>

<p>When aggregating security categories, it is also beneficial to understand the context of the information system in relation to other systems – standalone, connected process flow etc. Without understanding the overall context, assignment of security categories could be erroneous.  </p>

<p>At the end of step 1, categorization of information systems, the organization must have a spreadsheet with all the information systems that are being evaluated for the suitability of moving over to the public cloud. This spreadsheet will contain all web-based information systems and their aggregate security categories mapped to their business area or resource management functional area.  </p>

<h4 id="identify-security-requirements">2)  Identify Security Requirements</h4>
<p>NIST defines seventeen security-related areas with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and the information processed, stored, and/or transmitted by those systems [20]. Those security-related areas are access control, audit and availability, certification, configuration management, contingency planning, identification and authentication, incident response, maintenance, media protection, physical and environment protection, planning, personnel security, risk assessment, systems and services acquisition, system and communications protection, system and information integrity. </p>

<p>In the case of PaaS and SaaS, the majority of the selection of the security controls falls under the cloud agents such as the cloud provider, cloud broker, and cloud carrier. These cloud actors are required to address the cloud consumer’s areas of concerns as proposed by the NIST’s Security Reference Architecture [13] as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Risk Management
    <ul>
      <li>Risk analysis</li>
      <li>Risk Assessments</li>
      <li>Vulnerability assessment</li>
      <li>Incident reporting and response</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Business Continuity
    <ul>
      <li>Disaster recovery plans</li>
      <li>Recovery plans</li>
      <li>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</li>
      <li>Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Physical Security
    <ul>
      <li>Physical and environmental security policy</li>
      <li>Contingency plan</li>
      <li>Emergency response plan</li>
      <li>Facility layout</li>
      <li>Security Infrastructure</li>
      <li>Human Resources</li>
      <li>Visual inspection of the facility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>User account termination procedures</li>
  <li>Compliance with National and International/Industry standards on security</li>
  <li>Transparent view of the security posture of the cloud provider, cloud broker, and the cloud carriers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that an organization does not have to spend the time and money to create the combination of security components and how they map to responsibilities of various cloud actors from scratch. The CSA provides a comprehensive cloud control matrix based on the Trusted Cloud Initiative Reference Architecture (TCI-RA) as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/csa-cloud-control-matrix-1-4.png" alt="Table 2: The CSA Cloud Control Matrix v1.4" /></p>

<p>This excel sheet can be downloaded from [14]. What is good about this excel sheet is that it spells out the responsibility for establishing security controls among the various cloud actors. The NIST Security Reference Architecture (SRA) has adopted the TCI-RA and has created 346 security components under three different domains such as Business Operation Support Service (BOSS), Information Technology Operation Support (ITOS), and Security and Risk Management (S&amp;RM) and four different service layers such as infrastructure services, information services, application services, and presentation services. Therefore, this is a streamlined, transparent risk management process where the responsibilities are clearly delineated as shown in the table below:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/nist-sra-actor-based-responsibility-chart.png" alt="Table 3: The NIST SRA Actor-based Responsibility Chart" /></p>

<p>In the above chart, “X” indicates that the respective security component has to be implemented by the actor; “A” indicates that the security component has to be implemented internally; “B” indicates that this is for “business broker only” and there is no direct association with the consumer; blank cell indicates that the security component is not needed for securing the cloud platform. </p>

<p>There is a mapping of security components from the TCI-RA to the NIST 800-53 family of security controls in the “800-53 Family” column in the spreadsheet. In the above example, <strong>BOSS→ Compliance→Intellectual Property Protection</strong> is mapped to <strong>Access Control (AC)</strong>. Similarly, there is a mapping to Awareness and Training (AT) as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using the above methods, we now have a way to map security components to cloud deployment models with an eye towards which actor is responsible for what. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question now becomes as to what security components are absolutely needed by the consumer to have a secure move to the public cloud. This is where the combination of the last step – categorize information systems – and the security index system (SIS) comes in.  SIS defines five index values from zero to four as follows [13]:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/sis.png" alt="Table 4: The Security Index System (SIS)" /></p>

<p>Based on security category obtained from applying step one, the cloud consumer could go on to applying security index values to all the security components as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/nist-sis-draft.png" alt="Table 5: NIST SIS (Draft)" /><br />
<sub>* Ag = Aggregate score</sub></p>

<p>By following these steps, all the cloud actors know exactly what security components are needed for the migration and who is responsible for implementing them. This will also give an idea about choosing the right service model (PaaS or SaaS) for the web application in question.</p>

<p>CSA has a specific gap analysis model where the cloud actors could go about selecting the right set of security components for their cloud platform based on their compliance needs such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) etc. </p>

<p>For example, if an organization accepts, captures, stores, transmits, or processes credit/debit card data through one of its e-commerce application, the organization is expected to follow PCI DSS. </p>

<p>If the organization wants to migrate its application to the public cloud, all the relevant cloud agents – cloud consumer, provider, broker, carrier, and/or auditor – are expected to have all the necessary security components along with the controls in place to support the PCI DSS standard. To conform to PCI DSS standards, the cloud actors have to ensure that the following security components are implemented as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/csa-recommendation-for-pci-dss-on-public-cloud.png" alt="Table 5: NIST SIS (Draft)" /><br />
<sub>* Merchant = Cloud Consumer; PAN = Personal Access Number</sub></p>

<p>By the same token, similar security requirements can be gathered for HIPAA, GLBA, and SOX.</p>

<p>At the end of step two, all the relevant cloud actors must know the baseline security controls and any supplemental controls needed due to compliance needs of the cloud consumer. The selection of controls could be based on the in-house technical expertise of the cloud consumer along with its assurance needs.</p>

<h4 id="select-the-cloud-ecosystem-architecture">3)  Select the Cloud Ecosystem Architecture</h4>

<p>Based on the business requirements and the security requirements outlined in the previous section, a cloud consumer could make a decision to either go with a single cloud provider or a set of cloud providers with the help of a broker as shown in the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/broker-based-cloud-ecosystem-architecture.png" alt="Broker-based Cloud Ecosystem Architecture" /></p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where a consumer is in need of a web content management solution, a video encoding service so the consumer could post videos across a wide variety of social websites such as Facebook, Twitter etc. and a Web development platform based on the “Spring” framework. In order to avail all of the above services, the cloud consumer might need to seek the help of three different cloud providers as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cloud Provider A</em> – A SaaS-based Web Content Management Solution. E.g. SpringCM</li>
  <li><em>Cloud Provider B</em> – A SaaS-based Video Encoding services. E.g. Brightcove</li>
  <li><em>Cloud Provider C</em> – A PaaS-based Web development platform based on the Spring Framework. E.g. CloudFoundry.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to understand and implement all the security controls required to support the assurance needs, the cloud consumer has to deal with multiple Service Level Agreements (SLA) across the various cloud providers. Depending upon the technical expertise and the number of personnel supporting such efforts, the task of managing multiple SLAs could be daunting. This is where cloud brokers come in. As shown in the above figure, the cloud consumer is only signing one SLA with the broker leaving the entire responsibility of managing the business and security requirements across all of the cloud providers with the broker.</p>

<h4 id="assess-the-cloud-services">4)  Assess the Cloud Services</h4>

<p>Based on the set of security controls selected in step two and the ecosystem architecture selected in step three, the cloud consumer is well on the way to defining the service level agreement (SLA) with the intended cloud agent(s) – broker or provider(s). The SLA details the levels and types of services that are to be provided, including but not limited to the delivery time and performance parameters. A mind map of an SLA is shown below [13]:</p>

<p><img src="http://naruraghavan.github.io/images/mindmap-of-SLA.png" alt="The mind map of SLA" /></p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the cloud consumer to ensure that default contracts are not accepted when setting up the master service agreements. From a provider’s perspective it may be easy, but the agreement might not capture all of the assurance needs of the consumer.  </p>

<h4 id="authorize-cloud-services">5)  Authorize Cloud Services</h4>

<p>In this step, the cloud consumer must define a set of metrics that can validate the expectations defined in the service contract as stated in the previous step. The NIST Cloud Service Metrics document [21] defines a set of metrics for cloud services. An example is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Service Availability – Percentage of uptime of resource over a period of time where:
<script type="math/tex">
Service\_Uptime\_Percentage = \frac{Qualified\_Uptime\_Total}{Observation\_Time\_Total} \times 100
</script></p>

    <ul>
      <li>For example, the SLA could state that the objective of the service availability metric to be: <script type="math/tex"> Service\_Uptime\_Percentage=99\% </script></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A similar set of metrics must be defined in advance to ensure a proper delivery of services by the cloud brokers/providers. For example, “the number of concurrent users and the response time of the platform/service” could be one of the metrics.</p>

<h4 id="monitor-the-services-provided">6)  Monitor the services provided</h4>

<p>This is the crucial step to ensuring that the security controls that have been put in place as a part of securing the cloud service are functioning as intended and maintain the necessary security posture. Continuous monitoring enables the cloud agents to supplement security controls in case there is a need. A strategy for continuous monitoring could define as to how security and privacy controls will be monitored over time as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frequency of monitoring activities</li>
  <li>Rigor and extent of monitoring activities</li>
  <li>Data feeds to be provided to the consumer</li>
</ul>

<p>The continuous monitoring strategy allows the consumer to see whether the SLA terms are met on an ongoing basis. </p>

<p>Together, these six steps must be able to prepare an organization to successfully move to the public cloud for their Web application needs. </p>

<p>I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.</p>
