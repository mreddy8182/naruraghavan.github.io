    <p>Continuing from where we left off in <a href="http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-4"><strong>Part 4</strong></a>, lets start exploring the Secure Development Practices in this post.</p>

<h3 id="c--employing-secure-development-practices">C.  Employing Secure Development Practices</h3>

<p>Establishing a set of security libraries to do input and output validation, error handling, authentication and authorization, session management, secure resource access, secure communications, and secure storage [26] will help implement several security controls when moving to the cloud. Using a standard library will help contain the proliferation of inconsistent security implementations across teams for some known vulnerabilities. For example, OWASP Java Encoder library [27] could be used to implement secure coding requirements such as input and output validation and combat against a whole host of vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection attacks etc.</p>

<h4 id="input-validation">1)  Input Validation</h4>

<p>Developers have to ensure that the data received is a valid input for the software component in question. There are four techniques to make sure that the data received is valid as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Whitelisting input</p>

    <p>Using this technique, the developer defines a set of known input values. For example, a regular expression used for whitelisting an email address as input could be: </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">Boolean isGoodEmail = Pattern.matches(email,”^([a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+)@(([[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.)|(([a-zA-Z0-9-]+.)+))([a-zA-Z]{2,4}|[0-9]{1,3})(]?)$”);</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>Blacklisting input
Based on some known vulnerabilities, the developer could actively check for combinations of characters that are usually signs of cross-site scripting and remove them as follows:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">String clean_input = bad_input.replaceAll(Pattern.quote(“’”));</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>Canonicalization of Input
Canonicalization is an operation by which the input (that could have been encoded by a malicious user to send scripts via input parameters) is reduced down to its simple form. </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">String canonicalized_input = ESAPI.canonicalize(input);</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>Encoding/Escaping of Input
OWASP has published a library of Java methods [27, 28] to successfully encode or escape input data so that the input doesn’t contain any commands/scripts in them. For example, to ensure that there is no SQL scripting in the input, one could use the ESAPI as follows:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">String db_query_input = ESAPI.encodeForSQL(DB2_Codec, input);</code></pre></div>

<p>In the above code, by using the right codec for a database such as MySQLCodec, OracleCodec etc., the developer could potentially combat against SQL Injection Attacks. By maintaining a parameter-mapping table as shown below, a developer could apply necessary techniques to properly validate the input data.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/parameter-specs-for-input-validation.png" alt="Parameter Specs for Input Validation" /></p>

<h4 id="output-validation">2)  Output Validation</h4>

<p>Cross-site scripting attacks originate through poorly validated output of a web application. Attackers often use this technique to orchestrate phishing attacks and extract valuable information from unsuspecting end user. Depending upon where the output is going to end up on a web page, developers have to choose the correct encoding technique. For example, if the output is going to end up as a URL, the output has to be encoded with URL special characters such as “?” and “&amp;” etc. These characters have to be properly encoded with “%”. Once again, developers must start with a parameter table as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/parameter-specs-for-output-validation.png" alt="Parameter Specs for Output Validation" /></p>

<p>By using ESAPI (or a similar framework), encode the output as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">String safe_output_url = ESAPI.encodeForURL(output);</code></pre></div>

<p>By the same token, output destined to go within the body of the web page, use the following technique:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">String safe_output_html = ESAPI.encodeForHTML(output);</code></pre></div>

<p>Using the above technique, the “output” will be properly encoded to convert special HTML characters such as “&lt;” to “&lt;” etc. </p>

<p>On a similar note, other than URL (PercentCodec) and HTML (HTMLCodec) encoding techniques, there are</p>

<p>JavaScriptCodec, CSSCodec, and VBScriptCodec etc. to encode the output to go within a JavaScript, CSS, or VBScript.</p>

<h5 id="a--why-do-we-need-to-do-input-validation-at-the-server-side">a)  Why do we need to do input validation at the server side?</h5>
<p>Relying on client-side input validation is not recommended. By setting up a proxy such as WebScarab or BurpSuite etc., an attacker can easily bypass client-side validation completely as shown in the screenshot below:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/modification-of-input-using-webscarab.png" alt="Modification of Input using WebScarab" /></p>

<p>Using these client-side proxy tools, an attacker will be able modify the HTTP header variables, change the values of query parameters, and add new query parameters if necessary. Therefore, it is not enough to just rely on client-side validations.</p>

<h4 id="error-handling">3)  Error Handling</h4>

<p>This is the most important step a developer has to pay special attention to. Attackers formulate and fine-tune their attack vectors by inducing error conditions and see how the web application reacts to those errors. When an error is not properly handled, oftentimes, the error message gets displayed on the web page. These error messages provide vital clues to the attackers as to the type of operating system, database, web server, application server, and authentication server that the web application uses or is built with. For example, ESAPI has several predefined exceptions that can be thrown and handled in the code. Some of the exceptions include EncodingException, IntrusionException, and EnterpriseSecurityException etc.</p>

<h4 id="secure-storage">4)  Secure Storage</h4>

<p>As discussed in the responsibility chart of various cloud actors, securing the storage of certain sensitive information such as password, credit card numbers, personal identification number (PIN) etc. falls under the cloud consumer’s responsibility. Therefore, the development team from the consumer side has to ensure that appropriate techniques such as one-way hashing, encryption of sensitive information are performed in an effective manner. There are several industrial strength cryptographic packages available such as Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE), Bouncy Castle etc. that the development team could easily incorporate into their code to enable secure storage of sensitive information on the cloud.</p>

<p>For example, ESAPI provides Java methods that enable users to either hash or encrypt sensitive information. The difference is that hashed information cannot be decrypted and is ideal for password storage. On the other hand, encrypted data can be decrypted using a key and this technique is useful for securing the other sensitive information such as credit card numbers etc. </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">String hashed_password = ESAPI.hash(plaintext_password, salt);
String encrypted_credit_card = ESAPI.encrypt(plaintext_cc);</code></pre></div>

<p>What is interesting to note is the use of “salt” in the above hashing code. A salt is used as an additional input to a one-way hash function to strengthen the randomness of the resulting ciphertext. A good “salt” will combat against dictionary attacks and rainbow-table attacks. Since the hashes are randomized effectively by the use of the salt, the attackers are forced to change the dictionary/table constantly for comparison.</p>

<p>A similar technique must be employed to securely store property files. The property files are used in almost all of the layers and partitions of a web application. </p>

<h4 id="secure-communications">5)  Secure Communications</h4>

<p>Web pages that take any type of sensitive information, as input must be sent over a secure communication layer such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or the Secured Socket Layer (SSL). When using SSL, the use of SSLv3 is recommended over SSLv2, as SSLv2 is not considered secure. </p>

<p>By following these security principles along with a pre-fabricated security library such as ESAPI [28], developers can exercise secure coding practices and successfully contribute towards implementing the security controls that the cloud consumer is responsible for.  </p>

<p>I’ll contiunue my discussion in the next post.</p>

    <p>Continuing from where we left off in <a href="http://localhost:4000/public-cloud-for-corporate-web-applications-part-3"><strong>Part 3</strong></a>, lets start exploring the Software Engineering for the PaaS Service Model in this post.</p>

<h3 id="b--software-engineering-for-the-paas-service-model">B.  Software Engineering for the PaaS Service Model</h3>

<p>The software development environment has to lend itself to managing a wide variety of artifacts that emerge from a multitude of software life cycle management activities such as requirements management, change management, configuration management, build management, integration management, release management, and test management in the areas of define, design, code, test, and run [25]. In order to succeed in the security endeavor, there is a greater need to equip the development team with necessary software tools to enable complete tracing from requirements to code releases.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the overall development environment with tasks organized in terms of Development, QA, Automated, and Security:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/software-engineering-for-paas-service-model.png" alt="Software Engineering for PaaS Service Model" /></p>

<h4 id="development-aka-scrum-team-tasks">1)  Development aka. Scrum Team Tasks</h4>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/dev-team-1.png" alt="" />Product Owner creates user stories and epics in the Agile Requirements Management Server. Developers, Security experts, and the Scrum master break the user stories and epics into multiple tasks and assign appropriate estimates in terms of story points. One convention that the team could follow is to equate one story point to one ideal man-day – A day of development that can be done when there are no external distractions such as meetings, discussions etc. Based on the team’s velocity, appropriate number of stories is selected to be part of the Sprint. The team along with the security expert determines the number of security-focused stories to be included in the Sprint based on the business requirements. Each story will have a “How to Demo” field populated to assist the QA team in properly testing the various functionalities of the software component.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/dev-team-2.png" alt="" />The development team is responsible for periodically checking in/syncing/rebasing their code into the enterprise version control system. The developer as well as the code reviewer must look for the successful completion of static code analysis. The development team is also responsible for setting up and configuring the various life cycle management servers such as the version control system, continuous integration server, dependency management, agile requirements management server etc. From time to time, the development team will also be responsible for peer code reviews, refactoring of code to improve performance and other non-functional architectural requirements. An automated code crawler that reviews the code for vulnerabilities such as OWASP Code Crawler is highly recommended over manual code reviews. Using the “defense in depth” principles, more than one type of code reviews can be done. The first pass could be the automatic code inspection through code crawlers as stated above and the second pass could be a manual code review by a peer or a security expert.</p>

<h4 id="qa-team-tasks">2)  QA Team Tasks</h4>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/qa-team-1.png" alt="" />The QA team is responsible for performing the acceptance testing and reporting of the results to the development team. The acceptance testing will include both functionality and security-focused testing according to SAFECode stories. The acceptance testing is typically carried out in the Test Server as shown in the above diagram. The QA team is also responsible for configuring and writing test plans for the automated test server such as Selenium. </p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/qa-team-2.png" alt="" />The QA team is also responsible for performing tests against the QA and production environments on the public cloud as shown in the above diagram.</p>

<h4 id="security-team-tasks">3)  Security Team Tasks</h4>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/security-team-1.png" alt="" />One of the major tasks of the security team is to train the scrum team on security practices that will successfully implement the stipulated security controls. The security team is also responsible for installing and configuring the necessary static code analysis tools, malware scanners, and code vulnerability scanners that can be automatically run upon on a build. The Continuous Integration Server will not deploy if the successful build failed one of the security tests such as static code analysis etc.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/security-team-2.png" alt="" />The security team is also responsible for securing the code deployment to the public cloud in terms of network equipment such as Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems etc. There is a need to set up firewall rules in terms of connectivity guidelines from the PaaS service provider such as protocol (HTTPS), ports, time of day restrictions etc.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/security-team-3.png" alt="" />The security team has to work with the PaaS broker or provider to set up the necessary SLA and incorporate provisions for security controls as described in the risk management framework section. It is this team’s responsibility to ensure that the “continuous monitoring” strategy is established and followed upon at a time interval stipulated in the SLA.</p>

<h4 id="automated-tasks">4)  Automated Tasks</h4>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-1.png" alt="" />Establishing a Continuous Integration (CI) Server is well worth the time and money. It makes a lot of sense for the development team to carve some time out to establish a version control system such as Atlassian Stash along with a CI Server (if there are none) with deployment plans such as Test, QA, and Production with appropriate build plans. As can be seen in Figure 16, the CI Server, according to the build/deployment plans setup, checks out the necessary source code from the version control system and executes those plans. Based on the deployment plan, it deploys the software component on Test, QA, or Production server as prescribed.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-2.png" alt="" />The integration server, such as Atlassian Bamboo, deploys the software component on the Test server. It then notifies the QA team to start the acceptance testing for the software component.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-3.png" alt="" />The CI Server deploys the software component to the automated test server such as Selenium. The automated tests will also include security-focus tests such as code vulnerability testing, static code analysis, and running of malware scanners. These tools upon successfully completing their tests would notify the QA, security, and development teams with results.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/auto-task-4.png" alt="" />The CI Server deploys the software component in the PaaS environment on the public cloud. The deployment could be targeted for either the QA or the production environment. The server notifies the QA team to initiate testing on the QA or production stage.</p>
